27007353,How does data denormalization work with the Microservice Pattern?,2014-11-19 01:25:07,<database><denormalization><microservices>,4,6219,4,21.0,62,"<p>I just read an article on <a href=""http://java.dzone.com/articles/microservices-and-paas-part-2"">Microservices and PaaS Architecture</a>. In that article, about a third of the way down, the author states (under <strong>Denormalize like Crazy</strong>):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>Refactor database schemas, and de-normalize everything, to allow complete separation and partitioning of data. That is, do not use underlying tables that serve multiple microservices. There should be no sharing of underlying tables that span multiple microservices, and no sharing of data. Instead, if several services need access to the same data, it should be shared via a service API (such as a published REST or a message service interface).</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>While this <em>sounds</em> great in theory, in practicality it has some serious hurdles to overcome. The biggest of which is that, often, databases are tightly coupled and every table has <em>some</em> foreign key relationship with at least one other table. Because of this it could be impossible to partition a database into <em>n</em> sub-databases controlled by <em>n</em> microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I ask: <strong>Given a database that consists entirely of related tables, how does one denormalize this into smaller fragments (groups of tables) so that the fragments can be controlled by separate microservices?</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For instance, given the following (rather small, but exemplar) database:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>[users] table&#xA;=============&#xA;user_id&#xA;user_first_name&#xA;user_last_name&#xA;user_email&#xA;&#xA;[products] table&#xA;================&#xA;product_id&#xA;product_name&#xA;product_description&#xA;product_unit_price&#xA;&#xA;[orders] table&#xA;==============&#xA;order_id&#xA;order_datetime&#xA;user_id&#xA;&#xA;[products_x_orders] table (for line items in the order)&#xA;=======================================================&#xA;products_x_orders_id&#xA;product_id&#xA;order_id&#xA;quantity_ordered&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Don't spend too much time critiquing my design, I did this on the fly. The point is that, to me, it makes logical sense to split this database into 3 microservices:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><code>UserService</code> - for CRUDding users in the system; should ultimately manage the <code>[users]</code> table; and</li>&#xA;<li><code>ProductService</code> - for CRUDding products in the system; should ultimately manage the <code>[products]</code> table; and</li>&#xA;<li><code>OrderService</code> - for CRUDding orders in the system; should ultimately manage the <code>[orders]</code> and <code>[products_x_orders]</code> tables</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However all of these tables have foreign key relationships with each other. If we denormalize them and treat them as monoliths, they lose all their semantic meaning:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>[users] table&#xA;=============&#xA;user_id&#xA;user_first_name&#xA;user_last_name&#xA;user_email&#xA;&#xA;[products] table&#xA;================&#xA;product_id&#xA;product_name&#xA;product_description&#xA;product_unit_price&#xA;&#xA;[orders] table&#xA;==============&#xA;order_id&#xA;order_datetime&#xA;&#xA;[products_x_orders] table (for line items in the order)&#xA;=======================================================&#xA;products_x_orders_id&#xA;quantity_ordered&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Now there's no way to know who ordered what, in which quantity, or when.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So is this article typical academic hullabaloo, or is there a real world practicality to this denormalization approach, and if so, what does it look like (bonus points for using my example in the answer)?</p>&#xA;"

Say each page serves a separate usecase and i want to back eack of them with their own microservices. Now, which of these is the correct way of implementing a microservice based architecture:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>I create three different apps(microservices), each containing the (route, controller, models, templates) for one of the pages. And then based on which ever page is requested, I route the request to that particular app. This means that the whole page from database to HTML is served by a separate app. Basically, different pages in the same website are being completely served by different apps on the backend.</li>&#xA;<li>The 3 microservices do not handle the UI stuff but only the data for their usecases(models, controller, no templates) and expose it over a REST api. I have one public facing app. This app queries the three different apps(microservices) only for the data and then builds the html pages to be returned to browser. All the pages in a web app in this case are being served by a single app which internally makes use of three different microservices.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b62O1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>&#xA;"
22513893,Microservices and SOA using messaging,2014-03-19 17:39:26,<architecture><messaging><soa><microservices>,5,5075,0,8.0,21,"<p>I've been very interested in trying out microservices/SOA as an architecture and am having a hard time conceptualizing how the integration between services would actually be done.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I like the idea of using messaging to decouple the clients from the services, but don't understand how a system could utilize it exclusively. The typical async operations and pub/sub stuff obviously makes sense - scenarios like creating a new order, broadcasting data for reporting, etc. What I don't understand is whether people typically try to use messaging for common request/reply scenarios - for example, a user hits their ""profile"" page and part of the data that needs to get rendered on the page is from a user service.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know common messaging implementations provide REST-like reply/request functionality but is that often used for simple data requests? It seems more likely that microservices would both expose REST endpoints and also register with a message broker for different types of communication it will participate in, but all these presentations I watch of SOA and microservice architecture seem to suggest they only use one or the other..</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks for any elaboration/experiences!</p>&#xA;"

28767707,How to deal with shared state in a micro-service architecture?,2015-02-27 14:44:20,<deployment><architecture><integration-testing><microservices><test-environments>,3,4043,8,13.0,17,"<p>In our company we are transitioning from a huge monolithic application to a micro-service architecture. The main technical drivers for this decision were the need to be able to scale services independently and the scalability of development - we've got ten scrum teams working in different projects (or 'micro-services').</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The transition process is being smooth and we've already started to benefit from the advantages of this new technical and organizational structures. Now, on the other hand, <strong>there is a main point of pain that we are struggling with: how to manage the 'state' of the dependencies between these micro-services</strong>. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let's put an example: one of the micro-services deals with users and registrations. This service (let's call it X) is responsible for maintaining identity information and thus is the main provider for user 'ids'. The rest of the micro-services have a strong dependency on this one. For example, there are some services responsible for user profile information (A), user permissions (B), user groups (C), etc. that rely on those user ids and thus there is a need for maintaining some data sync between these services (i.e. service A should not have info for a userId not registered in service X). We currently maintain this sync by notifying changes of state (new registrations, for example) using RabbitMQ. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can imagine, there are <em>many</em> Xs: many 'main' services and many more complicated dependencies between them.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The main issue comes when managing the different dev/testing environments. Every team (and thus, every service) needs to go through several environments in order to put some code live: continuous integration, team integration, acceptance test and live environments. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Obviously we need all services working in all these environments to check that the system is working as a whole. Now, this means that in order to test dependent services (A, B, C, ...) we must not only rely on service X, but also on its state. <strong>Thus, we need somehow to maintain system integrity and store a global &amp; coherent state</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our current approach for this is getting snapshots of all DBs from the live environment, making some transformations to shrink and protect data privacy and propagating it to all environments before testing in a particular environment. This is obviously a tremendous overhead, both organizationally and in computational resources: we have ten continuous integration environments, ten integration environments and one acceptance test environment that all need to be 'refreshed' with this shared data from live and the latest version of the code frequently. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We are struggling to find a better way to ease this pain. Currently we are evaluating two options: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>using docker-like containers for all these services </li>&#xA;<li>having two versions of each service (one intended for development of that service and one another as a sandbox to be used by the rest of the teams in their development &amp; integration testing)</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>None of these solutions ease the pain of shared data between services</strong>. We'd like to know how some other companies/developers are addressing this problem, as we think this must be common in a micro services architecture. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How are you guys doing it? Do you also have this problem? Any recommendation?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sorry for the long explanation and thanks a lot!</p>&#xA;"

Everyone is talking and writing about. Personally i am thinking a lot about this topics: How this can be used to benefit from? What are possible challenges? How can this speedup the daily development? And how to manage all things?&#xA;One question that bothers me since a few days is ""How to manage secrets in a Microservice / Cloud environment?"".</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Imagine a company with 150 software engineers and various teams with various products. Every team is creating a software and every service needs various amounts of secrets (API-Keys, Passwords, SSH-Keys, whatever).&#xA;The ""old fashion"" way was to create a few configuration files in a ini / yaml / txt format and read it from. 12Factor apps say: Do it per env vars.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Env vars can be set per machine and the config files can be placed there as well.&#xA;This works if you got a hand full of machines and the deployment is done by a few system admins.&#xA;One of the general rules say: ""Don`t store secrets in a Git repo."".</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now the new world comes in.&#xA;Ever team is responsible for the application they produce itself.&#xA;They should be deployed and run by the team.&#xA;So our company is moving to a container and self-service way (e.g. Mesos and Marathon or Kubernetes).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course, Dockerfiles can set env vars as well. And yes, you can ADD your config file into the Docker container during build.&#xA;But with this everyone can access the secrets (e.g. from other teams). And no one knows who uses this secrets and do something dangerous.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You want to versionize your Dockerfiles as well. And applications you want to run on Marathon should be versionized (Git or whatever) as well (and applied by REST API). So where to store and manage all the secrets for this containers / apps?&#xA;Because with scheduler frameworks like Swarm and Machine (for Docker), Mesos and Marathon (usable for Docker as well) or Kubernetes you don`t know where your app will be running. This will be scheduled over several machines.&#xA;And most of this tools have no authentification (by default, of course this can be added by a Nginx proxy or something).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One idea to manage secrets is using a tool like <a href=""https://vaultproject.io/"">Vault</a>. But i never saw ""native"" support in an app. The same applies for <a href=""https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox"">Blackbox</a>. And i don`t know how configuration management can solve this. I know that Chef supports encrypted databags, but afaik it is not possible to use Chef to setup/build Docker containers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How do you manage secrets in a multi team env with several engineers in a Microservice / Container / Cloud environment?</p>&#xA;"

31313170,How to route in between microservices using Spring Cloud & Netflix OSS,2015-07-09 09:17:06,<spring-cloud><microservices><netflix-eureka><netflix-zuul><blue-green-deployment>,1,2730,2,16.0,17,"<p>During our development of microservices using Spring Cloud, we started out using Zuul as a proxy for any connection from the outside to microservices, and for any microservice needing to contact another microservice.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>After some time we made the conclusion that Zuul was designed to be an edge service (only proxying traffic from the outside to the microservices), and shouldn't be used for intermicroservices communication. Especially the way Spring Cloud recommends the use of eureka to make a direct (potentially load balanced) connection to another service made us go against having Zuul in between everything.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course everything works nicely as expected (as it always does with Spring Cloud), but we are clueless on how to perform a certain use case with this setup.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When deploying a new version of a microservice, we'd like to have a <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">blue/green deployment</a> with the old and the new version.&#xA;However, having no Zuul in between the microservices, the communication between two separate services will continue to go to the old version until it is removed from eureka.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We are thinking of how we can achieve this. In the picture below I have drawn what I think might be an option.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the first part of the picture, Zuul calls eureka to get the registry to create the routes. Also service 1 is calling eureka to get the registry to route to service 2. Since service 2 is in the eureka registry, the routing is done successfully.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the second part of the picture, an update of service 2 (service 2.1) is deployed. It registers with eureka as well, which makes service 1 now route to both service 2 and service 2.1. This is not wanted with the blue/green deployment.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the third part a potential solution to this issue is showcased with another instance of eureka being deployed just for this purpose. This instance isn't peer aware and won't sync with the first eureka instance. As opposed to the first instance, this one's only purpose is to facilitate the blue/green deployment. Service 2.1 registers with the second eureka instance, and service 1 his configuration is changed to fetch its registry not from the first but from the second eureka instance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V9lpR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The main question we are facing is whether this is a viable solution.

The only thing that matter is that Service X will never need to authenticate the user.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How do those two solutions compare in terms of:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>security</li>&#xA;<li>robustness</li>&#xA;<li>scalability</li>&#xA;<li>ease of use</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or maybe you would suggest another solution I haven't mentioned in here?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I like the solution #1 better but haven't found much default implementation that would secure me in the fact that I'm going in the right direction.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I hope my question doesn't get closed.

Each team is going to need a team integration environment... where they work with the latest snapshot of their microservice, along with stable versions of all dependency microservices.  Of course, you'll also need QA/staging/production environments as well.  A simplified view of the big picture would look like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>""Microservice A"" Team Environment</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Microservice A (<strong>SNAPSHOT</strong>)</li>&#xA;<li>Microservice B (STABLE)</li>&#xA;<li>Microservice C (STABLE)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>""Microservice B"" Team Environment</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Microservice A (STABLE)</li>&#xA;<li>Microservice B (<strong>SNAPSHOT</strong>)</li>&#xA;<li>Microservice C (STABLE)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>""Microservice C"" Team Environment</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Microservice A (STABLE)</li>&#xA;<li>Microservice B (STABLE)</li>&#xA;<li>Microservice C (<strong>SNAPSHOT</strong>)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>QA / Staging / Production</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Microservice A (STABLE, RELEASE, etc)</li>&#xA;<li>Microservice B (STABLE, RELEASE, etc)</li>&#xA;<li>Microservice C (STABLE, RELEASE, etc)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>That's a lot of deployments, but that problem can be solved by a continuous integration server and perhaps something like Chef/Puppet/etc.  The <strong><em>really</em></strong> hard part is that each microservice would need some environment data particular to each place in which it's deployed.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, in the ""A"" Team Environment, ""A"" needs one address and set of credentials to interact with ""B"".  However, over in the ""B"" Team Environment, <em>that</em> deployment of ""A"" needs a different address and credentials to interact with <em>that</em> deployment of ""B"".</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, as you get closer to production, environmental config info like this probably needs security restrictions (i.e. only certain people are able to modify or even view it).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, with a microservice architecture, how to you maintain environment-specific config info and make it available to the apps?  A few approaches come to mind, although they all seem problematic:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><strong>Have the build server bake them into the application at build-time</strong> - I suppose you could create a repo of per-environment properties files or scripts, and have the build process for each microservice reach out and pull in the appropriate script (you could also have a separate, limited-access repo for the production stuff).  You would need a <em>ton</em> of scripts, though.  Basically a separate one for every microservice in every place that microservice can be deployed.</li>&#xA;<li><strong>Bake them into base Docker images for each environment</strong> - If the build server is putting your microservice applications into Docker containers as the last step of the build process, then you could create custom base images for each environment.  The base image would contain a shell script that sets all of the environment variables you need.  Your Dockerfile would be set to invoke this script prior to starting your application.  This has similar challenges to the previous bullet-point, in that now you're managing a ton of Docker images.</li>&#xA;<li><strong>Pull in the environment info at runtime from some sort of registry</strong> - Lastly, you could store your per-environment config inside something like Apache ZooKeeper (or even just a plain ol' database), and have your application code pull it in at runtime when it starts up.  Each microservice application would need a way of telling which environment it's in (e.g. a startup parameter), so that it knows which set of variable to grab from the registry.  The advantage of this approach is that now you can use the <em>exact</em> same build artifact (i.e. application or Docker container) all the way from the team environment up to production.  On the other hand, you would now have another runtime dependency, and you'd still have to manage all of that data in your registry anyway.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How do people commonly address this issue in a microservice architecture?  It seems like this would be a common thing to hear about.</p>&#xA;"

We are seeing some great benefits with the separation of concerns, reusability, and other benefits of SOA/microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, one <strong>big</strong> item we're stuck on is aggregating, filtering, and paginating results across services.  Let me describe the issue with a scenario.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Say we have 3 services:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><strong>PersonService</strong> - Stores information on people (names, addresses, etc)</li>&#xA;<li><strong>ItemService</strong> - Stores information on items that are purchasable.</li>&#xA;<li><strong>PaymentService</strong> - Stores information regarding payments that people have made for different items.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, say we want to build a reporting/admin tool that can display / report on multiple services in aggregate.  For instance, we want to display a paginated list of Payments, along with the Person and Item that each payment was for.  This is pretty straightforward:  Grab the list of payments, then query PersonService and ItemService for the respective Person and Item records.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, the issue comes into play when we want to then filter down that data:  For instance, displaying a paginated list of payments made by people with the first name 'Bob', who have purchased the item 'Car'. This makes things much more complicated, because we need to filter results from 3 different services without knowing how many results each service is going to return.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>From a performance perspective, querying all of the services over and over again to narrow down the results would be costly, so I've been researching better solutions.  However, I cannot find concrete solutions to this problem (or at least a ""best practice"").  In a monolithic application, we'd simply use SQL joins across the different tables.  I'm having a ton of trouble figuring out how/if something similar is possible across services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question to the community is:  What would your approach be?  Things I've considered:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Using some sort of search index (<strong>Elasticsearch</strong>, <strong>Solr</strong>) that contains all data for all services (updated via events pushed out by services), and then querying the search index for results.</li>&#xA;<li>Attempting to understand how projects like <strong>GraphQL</strong> and <strong>Neo4j</strong> may assist us with these issues.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"

The service we are creating should be resilient with an 24/7 uptime.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Some devs already created a concept regarding what technologies to use. To make sure that the service is always available Kafka should be used. For example there should be a simple application/serverless function that adds something to an collection of items. The thin layer should create a Kafka message that will be processed by the real application later on.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the beginning this approach sound odd to me. Kafka is something to communicate between systems. But is it good to split applications even more to increase resilience for a bounded context? I guess not I thought. Because by using modern technologies the application can be very resilient. Therefore we can just create one application instead of adding a lot more complexity.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Later I understood that this approach is a CQRS like approach. By creating an application that receives the writes it will be completely separated from the reads. In this case Kafka will be used as an event system. It should maybe not delete old messages but however, I want to understand if this is a good way to go and if I am getting the things right.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What do you think about the requirements and the usage of Kafka to get a highly available and resilient application?</p>&#xA;"

So far so good, but we started to approach a way to keep all of them in a consistent state in terms of data.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically we split them according to our main entities in the solution. Those entities can work independently quite well but there's still some dependencies between them, which involves update a set of microservices when an entity from another microservice is modified.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We tried to tackle this challenge through different routes. &#xA;At first, we considered rabbitmq to be a good solution for this problem: a microservice sends a message with the change information to an exchange that fan outs it to the consuming microservices queues. Something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jMwO8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It seems a good solution, but we are a little bit worried about the data consistency if an error arises in any of the consumers: we would need to implement a strategy for reverting back those changes across all the consuming microservices. Also were considering a brokerless technology such as ZeroMq that could do the same trick without having the broker bottleneck.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We also thought of masstransit routing slip pattern implementation as a possible solution, so we could compensate all these errors in an easy way, but we are not that fond of having a sequential set of activities consuming these changes.

An aggregate is determined by the business and not by the infrastructure.</li>&#xA;<li>One should only define one repository per aggregate root to maintain transactional consistency between the objects within the aggregate (page 213)</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Unfortunately, in all further examples that are mentioned the aggregate root and all underlying objects that fall under it are within one and the same persistent data source.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The pattern then is as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>A repository is created containing that aggregate </li>&#xA;<li>In this repository a Unit of Work is injected during creation. This Unit of Work contains methods such as SaveChangesAsync, SaveEntitiesAsync, Update&#xA;and so on. </li>&#xA;<li>In a command, the Unit of Work manages the transactions to&#xA;this one data source such as a database or similar.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to expand this pattern that the aggregate can write its data over 2 or more physical data sources depending on the underlying object type.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Starting from starting point 1, it is perfectly justified to have a root aggregate and its underlying object to be updated to different data sources depending on the type of underlying object. Examples mentioned are : a Database and an XML file, a database and a NOSQL 'database',a database and a service,  a database and an IoT device. Because an aggregate must be ignorant to methods of persistence and infrastructure, to my opinion there is no need to argue about the design of the aggregate. I think nowhere in the book it is written that a aggregate root should persist within one data source.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At the same time, starting point 2 also seems perfectly justified. Because the complete set of objects within the aggregate root is edited, and the successful persistence of the entire package is coordinated from one repository and (preferably) from one Unit of Work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The question is: &#xA;How deals Domain Driven Design if within the aggregate - depending on the type of the underlying object - it is hydrated over different data sources?&#xA;Should I use one custom Unit of Work and make the decision where to write to within this UoW ? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm aware of the next <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3629500/unit-of-work-with-multiple-data-sources"">question</a> , but having studied the <a href=""http://dddpds.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">code</a> I think it only deals with inheritance of repositories that deal with different data sources, but still serving one data source at the time and that is not what I'm after. </p>&#xA;"

However, Spring, for example, only returns the username when calling /oauth/check_token, also in all JWT examples that I've  seen the username is included in the payload but not the ID.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But why does everyone seem to prefer the username over an ID, when usernames have so many drawbacks (they might change, they might not be unique, ...)?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And what would be the correct solution to get the ID?

Though with monolithic architecture it's understandable we must use more sophisticated structure to handle complexity.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, with microservice, it's unlikely we pack too much logic in one single service. Instead a service usually only contains related logic in one single domain, which is usually easy to understand and work upon.

The consumer will consume this message and do the appropriate action. Once the consumer ACK's the message process completion; MQ will move the offset to next one. I do not want my messages to be missed so I have to be sure that the messages were consumed successfully. Also I am trying to have this system consume messages exactly once(trying as close as possible).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I have following questions based on this understanding:-</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1)If I want my producer and consumer to be running more than one instance (for High availability) in the same DC then do I need to have both producer and consumer as separate Zookeeper services? Can all my different services(in a microservices world) need separate zookeeper server/instance or a same instance can solve this problem?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) When the messages are consumed by Consumer it will ACK the MQ after consuming it(completing the processing and taking action whatsoever required.). I am trying to understand how this will be faster for a system which will have thousands of requests every second. If we read more messages or do not wait for ACK till processing then in case of consumer Failure these messages will be missed as they were never processed successfully. I understand that having more consumers will make it work in parallel but am not clear how this concept works. Can someone explain me what will be the right way to consume and configure the interaction between components so that its optimized as well as persistent, high available, reliable and as closed to exactly once model. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: I am planning to use Java, Zookeeper,Kafka, Cassandra in the system.</p>&#xA;"

I understand the general concept but am struggling to see how it would work for our example.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Supposing I have an interface called <code>RatingEngine</code> and an implementation called <code>RatingEngineImpl</code>, both running inside my monolithic application.  The principle is simple - The <code>RatingEngineImpl</code> could run in a different machine, and be accessed by the monolithic application via (say) a REST API, serializing the DTOs with json over http.  We even have an interface to help with this decoupling.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But how do I actually go about this?  As far as I can see, I need to create a new implementation of the interface for the rump monolith (ie now the client), which takes calls to the interface methods, converts them into a REST call, and sends them over the network to the new 'rating engine service'.  Then I also need to implement a new http server, with an endpoint for each interface method, which then deserializes the DTOs (method parameters) and routes the call to our original <code>RatingEngineImpl</code>, which sits inside the server.  Then it serializes the response and sends it back to the client.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So that seems like an awful lot of plumbing code.  It also adds maintenance overhead, since if you tweak a method in the interface you need to make changes in two more places.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I missing something?

34163944,Zuul Autodiscovery issues,2015-12-08 19:04:35,<microservices><netflix-eureka><netflix-zuul>,1,453,0,1.0,0,"<p>We are in the process of standing up a new microservices architecture with Zuul at the front-end and a bunch of tomcat enabled microservices at the backend. Each service as it starts up, will register itself with Eureka and any client that wants to call those service will do so through Zuul. We've got this all wired in and everything is working fine. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I have a couple questions as to how we can make this architecture much more dynamic.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>One thing that we assumed was there out of the box with Ribbon/Eureka, but have yet to find a solution for is that as we add more services to the backend, that somehow (via Archiaus and update to Zuul's eureka-client.properties file) Zuul's Ribbon client would update itself with the new service details (e.g. vipaddress, load balancing algorithm, etc). So far, the only thing that works is to update the properties file and restart Zuul (ughhh).</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, let's say today we have 2 microservices at the backend, therefore, Zuul's eureka/ribbon client configuration would include the below:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>ribbon.client.niws.clientlist=service1|service2&#xA;zuul.ribbon.namespace=zuul.client</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>service1.zuul.client.DeploymentContextBasedVipAddresses=myService1&#xA;service1.zuul.client.NIWSServerListClassName=com.netflix.niws.loadbalancer.DiscoveryEnabledNIWSServerList</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>service2.zuul.client.DeploymentContextBasedVipAddresses=myService2&#xA;service2.zuul.client.NIWSServerListClassName=com.netflix.niws.loadbalancer.DiscoveryEnabledNIWSServerList</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now tomorrow, let's assume we need to add service3. What we have observed is that if we add those details to the same configuration (see below), they only become available to Zuul after a restart.

If you have a normalized database and a table for user, another for user address because one user may have one or more addresses (residential, comercial...) and another table for telephones for the same reason the micro service os client would use more than one table.&#xA;1 - In that case we can still classify it as micro service? (maybe my understanding of micro service could be incorrect or incomplete)&#xA;2 - If I can not classify it as micro service, than how to correctly develop a micro service for it?&#xA;3 - If the assumption that each micro service must use one table only to decouple than most cases of micro services could be resumed to CRUD exposition?</p>&#xA;"

I mean it is but...)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The idea being that I can cascade each service as a superset of the super-service. This would also allow me to cleverly inherit functionality for other services in a cascading service style. E.g.,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>unauthedApp > guestApp > userApp > modApp > adminApp, </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>for the application, where the functionality of the previous service are inherited to the preceding service (e.g., the further right along that chain, the more extra functionality is added and inherited).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this possible?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: If possible, is there a provided example of how to implement such a pattern using micro-services?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>[[[[[ BIG EDIT #2: ]]]]]</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Think I'm trying to make a solution fit the problem, so let me re-explain so this question can be answered based on the issue rather than the solution I'm trying to implement.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically, I want to ""inherit"" (for lack of a better word) the packages depended on needed functionality, so that no code is unnecessarily sent through the wire. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So starting with the core packages, which has libraries I want all of my services to have, I then want to further ""add"" the functionality as needed. Then I want to add page packages if serving a page-based service (instead of, say, the API service, which doesn't render pages), then the appropriate role-based page packages, etc., until the most specific packages are added.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My thought was that I could make the services chain in such a way that I could traverse through from the most generic to most specific service, and that would finally end with a composition of packages from multiple services. So, for e.g., the guestApp, that might be the core packages + generic page packages + generic app packages + unauthApp packages + guestApp packages, so no unneccessary packages are added.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also with this imaginary pattern I'm describing, I don't need to add all my core packages to each microservice - I can deal with them all within the core package right at the top of the package traversal I've discussed above and not have to worry about forgetting to add the packages to the ""inherited"" packages.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Hope my reasoning here makes sense, and I hope you guys know of a best practice for doing this. Thank you!</p>&#xA;"

He emphasises the need for asynchronous communication between miroservices, but says that APIs for external clients sometimes need to be synchronous (often REST).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've been trying to think how asynchronous response messages sent back from microservices should best be routed back to the waiting client. To me the most obvious way would be to record something like a request id in all messages sent when processing the request, and then copy this id into response messages sent by the services. The public API would block when processing the request, collecting all expected response messages which have the matching id, before finally sending the response to the client.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I on the right lines here? Are there better approaches? Do any frameworks take the work of doing this routing away from the developer (I'm looking at Spring Cloud Streams etc, but others would be interesting too)?</p>&#xA;"

So, if we have a single component to do a job, our application SLA would be the same (approx.). But if we create multiple components to do one job, our application's SLA would be reduced because all the components can go down at different time. In microservices, one service can communicate to other services to complete a task. Now, any of the participant service can be down at different time, So our application availability will be lesser compared to monolithic service?</p>&#xA;"

We have designed the microservices using DDD and are in the process of implementing basic functionality.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, there is a business need for users of the API to be able to be categorised into the client company that they work for, and only be able to access data for that client company as well as any role-based authentication we will have.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This isn't a full multi-tenant solution as every user will be working with the same website, but their account will have been associated with a particular client. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Everything I have read about doing something like this in AWS suggests using one user role or pool per client and associating users with it when they are created, however we do not want to do this, as the clients typically consist of 2-3 users and there are many clients. This would quickly become unmaintainable in terms of number of user pools.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to think of ways around this issue using ""conventional"" means, such as adding a domain service into the architecture which was solely designed to add client data to each request by a particular user by calling into the user microservice, but this seems overly complex. I also considered changing the architecture to include basic user and role information in each microservice, but that seems messy.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is are there any officially supported ways to add data into an AWS Cognito profile programmatically, and in such a way that this could be changed through a front-end website by a client admin after the account has been created? Even if it's just a clientId field in the token.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If not, then what would anybody who has experienced a similar issue recommend as an alternative to the user pools suggestion.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have also been investigating several ways to do this using attributes on Cognito profiles, as mentioned <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/managing-saas-identity-through-custom-attributes-and-amazon-cognito/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.

This is quite straightforward when the service is a singleton, but when it's partitioned we end up with several problems:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>We have to ask all partitions if the user already exists. We could possibly introduce another singleton service that maps user name to user id to overcome this problem.</li>&#xA;<li>There's a race condition. Two users could try to register the name user name at the same time. It's possible that both users could succeed.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm looking for general advice for possible ways to deal with situations such as this. I can imagine that this sort of problem would occur regularly with partitioned data.</p>&#xA;"

The dashboard is composed of a bunch of people and their infos (history, reviews, purchases, last products searched). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Reading spring-cloud and spring-reactor, I would like a non blocking solution calling multiple microservices : user service, review service, search engine service, .... </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My first guess was to do something like </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>load the users, </li>&#xA;<li>for each one load its reviews then </li>&#xA;<li>load its history then </li>&#xA;<li>combine all the data</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In pseudo-code something like <code>loadUsers().flatmap(u -&gt; loadReviews(u))....reduce()</code>. It's really approximative here as you can see.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When loading 1 user, we can estimate that we need 4 more http calls. For 100 users, 400 additional calls etc etc. <strong>The Big-O doesn't seem linear</strong>. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the worst case where a microservice also delegates data loading from a XYZ microservices then we have got : for 1 user -> N calls including 1 review call -> 1 XYZ call. Sorry I didn't calculate the Big-O (quadratic ?).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To avoid that, we can perhaps load all the users, extract their id, call earch microservcies with a batch of ids. Each microservices can load all the data at once (List of reviews mapped by id perhaps) and the original called will merge all theses lists. (a kind of zip function)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Summary</strong> : I just read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28402376/how-to-compose-observables-to-avoid-the-given-nested-and-dependent-callbacks"">this question about Observables composition</a>.

The resource server will now make another http call to the authentication server programmatically to verify the access token once the authentication server says yes then the resource server will serve request towards the completion (This way the resource server is totally isolated with the authentication process)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The other way would be to let the resource server verify the access token by talking to shared database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>which one of these is the more common in the industry? or any other ideas on how to verify the access tokens between authentication server and resource server?</p>&#xA;"

Services 1-3 are the backend that handle CRUD and serve JSON. There are other clients (not pictured) that do not access Frontend Service - namely, native clients such as Android and iOS. I'm trying to figure out the best way to serve common frontend content (such as header/footer/css) across all web clients. The best way I can think of doing this is to create a Frontend Service that each web client can access to pull this common information. That way changing the common front end will be reflected in each application immediately without need to update versions, recompile or redeploy.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>My question</strong> is what is the best way of doing this? I'm using Dropwizard to serve both the web clients and the services. The web clients serve Dropwizard Views (with freemarker templates) via Jetty. Is there a way to compose Dropwizard Views so that I can request a Header and a Footer view from Frontend Service and wrap these around each view returned from the Clients? Or am I going about this completely wrong? I know that Freemarker supports template inheritance but as far as I can tell this means the header/footer would have to live in each client or be pulled in from a common JAR (which would require updating version numbers and recompiling).</p>&#xA;"

38389706,Looking for help on how to manage microservices in Golang,2016-07-15 06:56:33,<go><deployment><microservices>,1,436,2,0.0,0,"<p>Currently, I deal with microservices on a daily basis at my 9-5.  Most everything that I touch is written in PHP, and as only a software engineer, SysOps manages everything that has to do with apps running, etc.  I have a little familiarity in how the infrastructure and build pipeline is setup, but I still am not a SysOps or DevOps guy.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With that said, I love Golang and for a side project, I am creating a fairly large web application with a lot of moving parts.  Writing and designing the code is easy as I have learned a lot from my day job, but deploying and managing Golang web apps (as they are executables) is quite different than updating files for apache to serve.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have researched a lot on how I would build and deploy my microservice apps, but I keep on thinking of more problems that will need to be solved along the way.  I have tinkered with the idea of using Docker for all of this, but I would rather not have the added complexity of learning that and managing storage for all of the images as that could be large.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a best practice or a good way to manage Golang applications after they have been deployed?  I would need a way to keep track of all the microservice processes to be able to see if they are still up and to be able to stop them when a new build is going to be deployed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As for the setup, just assume that all the microservices will be run on the server, not in a container or in a VM.  They will all need to be managed, but also able to act upon independently.  Jenkins will be used for building and deploying. I will be using Consul for service discovery and possibly configuration, and most likely health checks on the services.  I'm thinking of having each microservice register itself to consul when started and deregister when stopping.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Again, I am looking for a solution that is hopefully not just ""Docker"".  I also had thoughts into creating a deploy service that manages the services (add and remove), as well as registering them in Consul.  So if I cannot find a better solution, I might go that path.  Any help is appreciated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>** Sorry if my question was confusing, but since a couple people answered on the wrong topic at hand, I will try to clarify.  I don't need any help making the microservices, or even know anything about them.  I brought that point up as to why I need to ask my question.  Basically what I need is just the ability to manage the running go processes of all my microservices so I can do deployments and be able to stop and start processes to update the code.  It is easier when you have to worry about one app, but when you can have up to 10-15 difference microservices they become harder to keep track of.  After my own research, it seems that Supervisord is what I am looking for, but I'm not sure.  That is the direction I am going in with this question.  Thanks.</p>&#xA;"
38297333,Sharing data among Microservices‏,2016-07-10 23:27:59,<rest><design-patterns><enterprise><restful-architecture><microservices>,2,774,4,1.0,0,"<p>I'm seeking an answer to a design question that I didn't find an answer to in any literature on this matter. Allow me to explain the use case, my solution to it and, ask for your opinion as a subject matter expert.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Use Case</strong>:&#xA;We've several Microservices that all return some form of content from different business domains. We're using Spring Cloud Netflix, so a gateway service routes traffic to the content services. Some, if not all, of these services require data that is derived from the request, and is immutable. A trivial example is locale, although there are other proprietary information too.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Solution</strong>:&#xA;I'm currently deriving the shared data in the gateway service and persisting as JSON in a NoSQL database with a unique key. Then I'm adding the key as a request header before routing the request. I've a shared library that the content services include at build time, and includes a Spring bean that reads the key from the request header, fetches the stored data using the key and initializes itself. This makes it possible for the content services to access the shared data (by simply injecting the previously mentioned bean) without knowing the underlying mechanism.&#xA;If a content service invokes another one, it's responsible for adding the unique key as a request header.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Debate</strong>:&#xA;The debate I've with my colleagues is that whether using a shared datastore for this purpose is appropriate. I contend that it is bad for a service to leak it's domain specific data to others, but the data in question isn't domain specific, so there's nothing wrong with having a shared database and passing the key around. The alternative would be to pass all the shared data around which I consider redundant.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is your thought?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I see someone voted to close the question. Unless they can point me to a reference that discusses data sharing among Microservices, such policing is a hindrance to meaningful discussion. Not every question is a boolean yes/no answer, some require deeper thoughts.</p>&#xA;"

Usually, this relies on the maven parent/child relationship for all sub-projects (jars, wars) during the release process (monolith source code, all living in a single git repository). I'm wondering how do people maintain different boot projects (microservices) and make releases.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The way I see it, the following are possible strategies:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>One Spring Boot project (microservice maven project) per git repository so that releases are managed independently. </li>&#xA;<li>A Multi-Module maven project with each module being a microservice.

The issue is the browser itself has a 'Go to entry point' button which, when pulling it in as a <a href=""https://github.com/Product-Foundry/hal-browser-webjar"" rel=""nofollow"">webjar</a>, is hardcoded to <code>/</code>. The other alternative is to ditch the webjar and just copy in the static files for the browser and update the entry point.</p>&#xA;"

Currently, the way the services communicate with each other is an unsustainable mess, so I'm looking into other solutions.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One approach that looks very appealing to me is to use a message broker, where each service sends and listens to messages. Apache Kafka has caught my attention and looks like a very promising choice of software for this purpose.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm not sure how I'd use Kafka's topics, or more specifically, at what level to map the events to topics. I've identified three major levels of granularity, described below.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For demonstration purposes, consider a hypothetical online store consisting of a number of services such as ShoppingCart, Billing and Shipping.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>The whole application uses one topic</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One single topic, e.g. <code>my-app-events</code>, is used to channel all events sent and received by the services. An event might look like: <code>{""from"": ""shopping-cart"", ""name"": ""PRODUCT_ADDED"", ""payload"": {""product_id"": 137}}</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Each microservice uses its own topic</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Separate topics, such as <code>shopping-cart-events</code>, <code>billing-events</code>, <code>shipping-events</code> etc. are used. Now an event in the <code>shopping-cart-events</code> topic might look like <code>{""name"": ""PRODUCT_ADDED"", ""payload"": {""product_id"": 137}}</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Each event type uses its own topic</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here each possible message has its own topic. I suppose it'd make sense to include the producer of the event in the topic name, so that a topic might be called <code>shopping-cart.product-added</code>. In that case, the message contents would simply be the payload, e.g. <code>{""product_id"": 137}</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I hope I made the difference clear between the three approaches. What do you suggest? Have you used Kafka (or any other message broker) successfully in this way? What are the advantages and pitfalls with each of the solutions?</p>&#xA;"

There will also be a gateway where this security will be added. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is regarding the user roles and the security between internal microservices. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When the user is created, he should be granted a set of roles and he may be granted different ones at a later point or maybe new roles will be added later. All this information should be stored in the Authorization Server. But how is this information replicated to other microservices? If I use a framework like Spring Security to secure my endpoints, where I add the roles needed for the different URLs, do I need to hardcode the user roles into my security configuration in the downstream microservices or is there any other way to find them from the Authorization Server? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The architecture is going to use an API gateway in a public network that then communicates with a service discovery in an internal one to find the different microservices.

I understand that to use Spring Security for authorization I would need to pass the JWT token anyway to get the user roles. But would it be necessary otherwise? Would it be enough to use HTTPS from the client to the gateway and unsafe HTTP within the private network?</p>&#xA;"

I want to split the applications into micro services and I'm trying to figure out which approach I should use. I drew attention to the Spring Cloud Netflix and the Spring Cloud Data Flow toolkit, but it's not clear to me whether they can be integrated and how.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As an example, suppose we have the following functionality in the system:&#xA;1. information about users</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol start=""2"">&#xA;<li>card of orders</li>&#xA;<li>product catalog</li>&#xA;<li>sending various notifications</li>&#xA;<li>obtaining information about the orders from third-party systems</li>&#xA;<li>processing, filtering, and transformation of order events</li>&#xA;<li>processing of various rules based on orders and sending notifications</li>&#xA;<li>sending information about user orders from third-party systems to other users using websockets (with pre-filtering)</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Point 1-4 - there I see the classical micro service architecture. Framework - Spring Netflix Stack.&#xA;Point 5-9 - it's best to use an event-driven approach. Toolkit - Spring Data Flow.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The question is how to build communication between these platforms.&#xA;In particular - POPULATE ORDER DETAILS SERVICE must transform the incoming orders and save additional information (in case it needed) in the database. ORDER RULE EXECUTOR SERVICE should obtain information about the current saved rules, execute them and send notifications. WEB SOCKET SERVICE should send orders information only if a particular user has set the filters, and ORDER SAVER SERVICE should store the information about the transformed orders in the database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCqZ8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCqZ8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Communication between the micro-services within the two platforms could be using the API GATEWAY, but in this case, I have the following questions:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Does the Spring Cloud platform allow to work with micro services that way?</li>&#xA;<li>Performance - the number of events is very huge, which can significantly slow down the processing of events.

I am trying to understand the role that an api gateway plays in a modern web application using many microservices. I have been reading the documentation and tutorials of express-gateway but am a bit confused on how a web application would perform authentication with an api gateway set up like express-gateway.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My web app would have multiple microservices that it would talk to. I thought that putting an API gateway in front of all my microservices would make it so that each microservice would not need to worry about whether a user/request is authenticated or not, because if the microservice was being talked to it meant that the api gateway had verified the request was a valid user. Is my understanding of this correct?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Assuming that my thought of the api gateway serving as a gatekeeper to other microservices is correct, my follow up question is with the specifics of how it is performed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does this mean that all user creation and authentication is performed by the api gateway? Meaning that I would have no custom user creation/login microservices? Or would I have a publically reachable through the api gateway custom user creation microservice which upon creation would itself create the user accounts within the api gateway? Is user information now duplicated by my microservice in a database somewhere and the express-gateway's own storage? I guess my general confusion is around does an api gateway take the role of authentication/user creation entirely away from a web app's own microservices, or do you still need both parts?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I thought that my own authentication microservice would first validate a user then work with the api gateway to generate a valid short lived token, but reading about creating user or app accounts for authentication in express-gateway has made me confused on the roles each play.</p>&#xA;"

51697673,"Microservice design with Kubernetes - API gateway, communication, service discovery and db issues",2018-08-05 19:42:13,<node.js><database><rest><kubernetes><microservices>,1,69,1,2.0,0,"<p>Recently I have been researching about microservices and kubernetes. All the tutorial and article I read online talks about general staff. I have several specific questions about building a microservices app on kubernetes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><strong>API gateway:</strong> Is API gateway a microservice I built for my app that can automatically scale? Or is it already a built-in function of kubernetes? The reason I ask is because a lot of the articles are saying that load-balancing is part of the API gateway which confuse me since in kubernetes, load-balancing is handled by <code>service</code>. Also, is this the same as the API gateway on AWS, why don't people use the AWS API gateway instead?</li>&#xA;<li><strong>Communication within services:</strong> from what I read only, there are <em>Rest/RPC</em> way and <em>Message queue</em> way. But why do people say that the <em>Rest</em> way is for sync operation? Can we build the services and have them communicate with rest api with <code>Nodejs async/await</code> functions? </li>&#xA;<li><strong>Service Discovery:</strong> Is this a problem with kubernetes at all? Does kubernetes automatically figure out this for you?</li>&#xA;<li><strong>Databases:</strong> What is the best practice to deploy a database? Deploy as a microservice on one of the node? Also, some articles say that each service should talk to a different db. So just separate the tables of one db to several dbs?</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"
51682257,Using Swagger to Manage Microservice Architecture Across IIS Express,2018-08-04 03:50:52,<reactjs><visual-studio><swagger><asp.net-core-2.0><microservices>,1,28,2,0.0,0,"<p>I'm coming into an existing application where a single React application exists that calls multiple APIs. The APIs are written in .NET Core and I've been instructed they are typically hosted with IIS Express when debugging locally.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where I'm running into trouble is understanding how the React application will hit the backend API projects, when the API projects are running on multiple IIS Express instances that don't have static ports.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For instance, I'll hit ""run"" on the React project which launches the React application along with a controller that might be running on localhost:5888. I can easily hit the controller from the React application using <code>window.host + /Controller/</code> which will handle resolving the port for me. However, if I ""run"" another API, from a separate Visual Studio instance, it'll get hosted on a random port, something like localhost:5889. If I try to hit that API with <code>window.host + /SecondAPIMethod/</code> from the React application, it'll come up with a 404 error, because the React app doesn't know what port the IIS express instance with the second API is running on.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've been told by coworkers that Swagger is the key to managing this, but I'm unsure how.</p>&#xA;"
51670858,Is it better to put multiple files in background job or a single file?,2018-08-03 10:41:30,<php><rest><api><microservices><beanstalkd>,1,34,2,0.0,0,"<p>Few months ago i asked <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49625076/obtaining-result-from-async-api"">this</a> about the implementation of my api for processing files it uses PHP, a command line script that is called via PHP and queue. For the queue i am using beanstalkd</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The API accepts one file or group of files (up to 5) per request. Processing one file takes 1-3 seconds depending of the size. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question now is whatever will be better, to put every file of the request to a separate job or all the files in one job? My function for processing that is slow accepts one or multiple files. My guess is that i put the all the files of the request on processing, they will be processed by one worker. But if i put every file into separate background job it will be probably processed by own worker so 4 files 4 workers - that is what i think. Not sure if this is correct.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So if my above conclusion is correct, is it better for a lot of requests to process all files in once or add them separate worker?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you.</p>&#xA;"

Initially an account can have $100 and the first instance gets that and increments it to $10 but has not been commited yet. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At the same time the second instance also retreive's account which is still 100 and increments it by $10 and then commits it updating balance to $110 and then service one updates account again to $110.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>By this time you must have figured that balance was supposed to be incremented by $20 and not 10. Do I have to write some kind of Optimistic lock exception mechanism to prevent the above scenario or will Transaction Manager based on JTA specification already ensure such a thing will not happen ?</p>&#xA;

42046797,"New to Microservices - refactoring a monolith ""Marketplace"" database",2017-02-04 23:20:58,<oop><microservices>,1,180,3,0.0,0,"<p>I am new to microservices and have been struggling to wrap my brain around it. On the surface they sound like a good idea, but from a practical standpoint, I can't break away from my centralized database background. For an example, I have this real-world Marketplace example that I cannot figure out if microservices would help or hurt. This site was working well until the PO asked for ""Private Products."" Now it is fragile and slow so I need to do a major refactor. A good time to implement microservices. I feel like many systems have this type of coupling, so that deconstructing this example would be very instructive. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Current State</strong> </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is a b2b marketplace where users belong to companies that are buying products from each other. Currently, there exists a monolithic database: User, Company, Catalog, Product, and Order. (This is a simplification, the actual scenario is much more complicated, users have roles, orders have header/detail, products have inventories, etc.)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Users belong to Companies</li>&#xA;<li>Companies have a Catalog of their Products</li>&#xA;<li>Companies have Orders for Products from other Companies </li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So far so good. I could see breaking the app into microservices on the major entity boundaries. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>New Requirement</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Unfortunately for my architectural aspirations, the product owner wants more features. In this case: Private Products.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Products are Public or Private</li>&#xA;<li>Companies send time-bound Invitations to Products or Catalogs to Users of other Companies</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This seemingly simple request all the suddenly complicated everything.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Use Case - User displays a list of products</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, listing or searching products was once just a simple case of asking the Products to list/search themselves. It is one of the top run queries on the system. Unfortunately, now what was a simple use case just got messy.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>A User should be able to see all public Products (easy)</li>&#xA;<li>A User should be able to see all their own Company's private Products (not horrible)</li>&#xA;<li>A User can see any Product that their Company has Ordered in the past regardless of privacy (Uh oh, now the product needs to know about the User Company's Order history) </li>&#xA;<li>A User can see any private Product for which they have an active Invitation (Uh oh, now the product needs to know about the User's Product or Catalog Invitations which are time dependent)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Initial Monolithic Approach</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This can be solved at the database level, but the SQL joins basically ALL of the tables together (and not just master data tables, all the transactions as well.) While it is a lot slower than before, since a DBMS is designed for big joins it seems like the appropriate tool. So I can start working on optimizing the query. However, as I said, for this and other reasons the system is feeling fragile.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Initial Design Thoughts... and ultimately my questions</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So considering a Microservices architecture as a potential new direction, I began to think about how to start. Data redundancy seems necessary. Since, if I translate my major entities into services, asking to get a list of products without data redundancy would just have all of the services calling each other and a big slow mess. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Starting with a the idea of carving out ""Product and Catalog"" as its own microservice. Since Catalogs are just collections of Products, they seem to belong together - I'll just call the whole thing the ""Product Service"". This service would have an API for managing both products and catalogs and, most importantly, to search and list them.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As a separate service, to perform a Product search would require a lot of redundant data as it would have to subscribe to any event that affected product privacy, such as:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Listen for Orders and keep at least a summary of the relationship between purchased Products and Purchasing Companies</li>&#xA;<li>Listen to Invitations and maintain a list of <strong>active</strong> User/Product/Time relationships </li>&#xA;<li>Listen to User and Company events to maintain a User to Company relationship</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I begin to worry about keeping it all synchronized. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the end, a Product Service would have a large part of the current schema replicated. So I begin to think, maybe Microservices won't work for this situation. Or am I being melodramatic and the schema will be simpler enough to be more managable and faster so it is worth it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Overall, am I thinking about this whole approach properly? Is this how microservice based designs are intended to be thought through? If not, can somebody give me a push in a different direction?</p>&#xA;"

I want to create system in Microservice architecture with CQRS. I imagine that Microservice A will Handle bunch of Commands and Events but other Microservice can listen on that Event too.

Then this nuget will be consumed by Microservice B which will implement own Handlers based on Contract.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Microservice A solution:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>MicroserviceCode (Commands and Handlers with business logic etc)</li>&#xA;<li>DomainContract (Events that can be shared between many services but&#xA;are connected to current solution domain)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>MicroserviceCode has project dependency to own DomainContract and other DomainContract nugets</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But then I realized that when Microservices will grow and grow and more &#xA;dependencies will come it can start nuget hell and cause dependencies issues because of wrong nuget packages etc. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I also thought about sharing contract as a Rest API in Json format and eliminate nuget versioning.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would like to discuss about any tips how to avoid hell dependencies between Microservices. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or maybe you worked with the approach that I describe and it's not that bad than I think?:)</p>&#xA;"
51122354,Coupling in microservices architecture,2018-07-01 10:11:20,<microservices><coupling>,1,33,3,0.0,0,"<p>When working on an application in microservices architecture I stumbled upon issues concerning coupling between services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This a typical application for ordering products. It seams reasonable to have a service that will operate as a product catalog. Our JavaScript client can ask this service for available products and show them in browser. When user clicks on a product we have to create an order. We would like to manage orders in another service. So an order is created - it means that user X ordered product Y. On the technical level we are simply persisting user id and product id in a database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To sum up we have:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h3>Products service</h3>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Product class:<br/>&#xA;Product ID, Product Name </p>&#xA;&#xA;<h3>Orders service</h3>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Order class:<br/>&#xA;Order ID, Product ID,  User ID,   Order date  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now let's imagine following scenario - in JavaScript client we would like to list all products that user have ordered. Orders service provides a list of products ids for a given user. But user cares about product name, not the id. Unfortunately Orders service doesn't know anything about products names.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We could tackle this in couple of ways:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>Simply assume that the client is responsible for getting the information it needs. So after it calls Orders service and gets a list of products ids, it performs another call to Products service, passing products ids and getting corresponding products names in response. Then the client assembles both responses into something useful. This approach keeps our services clean, without leaking of domain knowledge from one service to another. But it requires more work on the client side.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Orders service when asked for ordered products makes a call on the backend to the Products service. It retrieves product names, assembles a response that contains orderDate and  productName and sends that to client. All that's left for client to do is to present the data. Downside of this approach is that Orders service now gains more knowledge about products than neccessary.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Duplicate information about product name in Orders service. When an order is created, we pass not only product id but also product name. That means that Order class will look like this:&#xA;Order class:<br/>&#xA;Order ID, Product ID, Product name, User ID, Order date<br/>&#xA;Now we can easly provide full information about order without additional call to Products service. Also this time Orders service has too much knowledge about products. What's beneficial tough is that Orders service can provide relevant data even if Products service is down.</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Could any of these approaches be considered best practice? Or are there different solutions?</p>&#xA;"

Our database&#xA;design satisfies Boyce Codd Normal form and we can design intuitive REST end points.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>/fruits(/:id)&#xA;/colors(/:id)&#xA;/fruits/:id/colors&#xA;/colors/:id/fruits&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Enter NoSQL databases. Colors is an attribute of the Fruits entity sets itself and it's domain is a set of varchar. If I were to insert Apple into the dataset and associate&#xA;colors red and green, I would have to store these strings as a part of that record in a set.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What if I want to update the entity now and remove green from the list ? Or maybe add a new color to the list ?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Should this be broken into a separate endpoint irrespective of the underlying database design ?

The setup is simple.  Suppose I have 3 clusters, each with 3 instances all separate from each other running on their own EE server instances on different machines.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>Cluster A&#xA; A1, A2, A3&#xA;&#xA;Cluster B&#xA;  B1, B2, B3&#xA;&#xA;Cluster C&#xA;  B1, B2, B3&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And I have a central JMS server which has a queue they all listen to:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>A1, A2, A3 |&#xA;B1, B2, B3 |&lt;-------&gt; JMS Queue (Q1)&#xA;C1, C2, C3 |&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Microservice instance A2 processes a request and publishes Message (M) onto (Q1).  What I want to happen is that for each of the other clusters - B,C - one instance in that cluster picks up the message and processes it for the cluster.  It obviously doesn't matter which instance picks it up as long as it is only processed one time per cluster.  So it would look like&#xA;                                             </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>A2 | ---&gt; publish (M) ----&gt; JMS Queue (Q1)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;B2 |&#xA;   | &lt;---- (M) &lt;----- JMS Queue (Q1)&#xA;C1 |&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This seems like a very common, almost default setup that everyone would need.  But so far what I've found with the way queues work is that once (M) get published to (Q1) then only one of B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3 will pick it up and process it and not one from each cluster like I'm looking for.  If I use a Topic, then every instance in every cluster would get a message so it doesn't seem like this is what I'm looking for either.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So that's it. Thoughts?

In this project we are building a small game where a user can fly a plane and shoot down other players online, hosted on the Amazon Web Services. The duration of a game should be about 10 minutes, a million games should (theoretically) be able to be played at the same time and about a thousand players should be able to play in a single game. So the application must really be scalable.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We are now hitting a hard part in the architecture. We want the server to calculate the positions of the players. Meaning that server gets key input requests with which it recalculates positions. Problem is that, because the application is scalable and there isn't just one server doing all the calculations and holding all the data, the input events will probably end up in different locations. We expect that constantly writing all positions to a database and reading it back to the client is too slow nor scalable enough. Also we don't want dedicated servers for single games as that could just waist the computation power (and money)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We have searches for different implementations by other game architectures, like messaging, but to no avail, we could not find any method that seamed fitting. We would like to know if there is any kind of pattern that could make this kind of implementation work? All we really need is a sense of direction for some possible patterns.</p>&#xA;"

First, if in a microservices architecture, each service can be developed independently how do we account for inter-service communication dependencies ? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, if Service A and Service B need to communicate, A needs to send an event to a central bus which B needs to listen for and act upon, but this seems to create a lot of dependencies. Now, if I am developing Service B, i need to know all of the events that Service A can generate. Also, if service A adds any new event, Service B also needs to change in order to handle that new event. All of this seems to create a dependency nightmare, and seems like you cannot truly develop each service 'independently'.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Secondly, how is a request/response type scenario handled at the API gateway or process manager level ? If the top level request fires off a bunch of cascading or interdependent events which need to be handled before returning a response to the caller, is this a scenario suited well for microservices ?</p>&#xA;"

Do not wonder about servicename() .. it replaced by a m4 macro during image build time</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>The clients are secured by a gossip key and ACL keys </p></li>&#xA;<li><p><strong>Important:</strong> All containers are on the same hardware node</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Server configuration looks like this, if any important.

The reason i ask is, because as far as i understand, the node-id duplication issue i get now when starting a 0.8.1 comes from ""the host"" being the same, so the hardware node being identical for all consul-agents .. right?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is my design wrong or do i need to generate my own node-ids from now on and its all just fine?</p>&#xA;"

Now, let's say that I want to upgrade the microservice - for example, some configuration is changed, and I need to re-run it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have two options:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>I can try to re-use existing image, by having a script that runs on containers startup and that updates the microservice by reading new config (if there is) from some shared volume. After the update, script runs the microservice. </p></li>&#xA;<li><p>I can simply drop the existing image and container and create the new image (with new name) and new container with updated configuration/code.</p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Solution #2 seems more robust to me. There is no 'update' procedure, just single container creation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, what bothers me is if this re-creation of the image has some bad side-effects? Like a lot of dangling images or something similar. Imagine that this may happens very often during the time user plays with the app - for example, if developer is trying out something, he wants to play with different configurations of microservice, and he will re-start it often. But once it is configured, this will not change. Also, when I say <em>configuration</em> I dont mean just config files, but also user code etc.</p>&#xA;"

Since all of them are REST API services, the benefits and whole point of using API gateway is clear to me. Now what about frontend microservices - the small components, that have both UI and corresponding backend to handle internal communication? Are there any scenarios where proxying every microservice HTTP calls is harmful?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Example</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One of our microservice is a payment provider integration. As dealing with payments have specific regulations, one of those is a <strong>required</strong> web browser redirect to the user's bank page for authorization. Since this is impossible to do in a purely backend way, we deliver a <em>frontend microservice</em> - a service that essentially serves a HTML you must nest inside an iframe and should be able to process the payment in an e2e way. Very simplified and stripped example below.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let's say you are on <code>https://acme.com/order</code> and want to pay, where such snippet is embedded:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=""https://pay.acme.com?amount=42+USD&#xA;                                 &amp;returnUrl=https://acme.com/thankyou/[orderId]""&gt;&#xA;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically a fire and forget thing for the developers of <code>https://acme.com</code>. What happens inside an iframe stays there. <code>https://pay.acme.com</code> however now worries about: collecting credit card details, validating them, redirecting user to the bank page to enter 2FA code or whatever needed, waiting until the payment is approved and finally moving user back to the <code>returnUrl</code> with a proper trail for which order the payment was finalized (<code>orderId</code>). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, what about <code>pay.acme.com frontend &lt;-&gt; pay.acme.com backend</code> communication? Would it be OK to let microservice talk to itself, or rather all, even the internal communication that doesn't make any sense for API consumers, must go through the API gateway? That is of course possible to do and still keep the microservice decoupled and unaware of the API gateway, but this is much more costful than deviating from the <em>always do</em> constraint and bring very small benefits, as we don't use any advanced rate limiting or proxying features for now.</p>&#xA;"

That change should trigger a call to the notification service to send the notification.<br>&#xA;The questions begin from how to handle and should I even consider doing a kind of clients for my services? &#xA;What I have in mind right now is to make Python packages or simply use git sub modules to handle that, like so:<br>&#xA;Having and endpoint <code>data.service.local/api/v1/food</code> I would like (I think) to make a 'provider' that would allow me to use that endpoint in a easy way:  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>class DataServiceProvider(object):&#xA;&#xA;    BASE_URL = settings.DATA_SERVICE_URL&#xA;&#xA;    def create_food(self, name):&#xA;        return requests.post(BASE_URL + 'food', {'name': name})&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Should I even bother?

Is it overwriting the old data or also creating a new entry with a version? That seems to be quite redundant? Do I in fact really need the SQL database here?</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>how can the main app call for data from the query service if one don't want to uses REST?</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Because it stores all commands in the event DB (6. docker container) it is possible to restore every state by running all commands again in order.

But with microservices, this becomes a problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One solution is to make microservice-A go to 5-10 other microservices to get necessary data (this is equivalent of DB view with join). Another solution is to make microservice-A listen to events from 5-10 other services and populate local storage with relevant into (this is an equivalent of materialized view). Either way, microservice-A is coupled with 5-10 other services, and if new info is needed in microservice-A, the some of the services that it depends upon might will need to be release prior to microservice-A. Please note that microservice-A is itself depended upon by other services.

My only coding experience has been simple programs in a variety of languages. I am trying to understand microservices and REST APIs. I have done a lot of searching, but  can't seem to find a clear example of how to connect microservices with APIs to send and receive information between them. Can anybody at least lead me in the right direction? I know there are problem a ton of ways and different for every language, so here an example below. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, pretend I have a simple javascript program with HTML and CSS for a simple UI. Let's assume I also have a seperate javascript program with no UI and all it does it calculate some numbers. How would I use an API to GET/POST two numbers to the calculator ""microservice"" and after calculating, that ""microservice"" would GET/POST that result back to the UI ""microservice""? Can I test this as just two javascript files locally on my laptop by just using localhost for the URL in the API/HTTP Request?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>NOTE: I put microservice in quotes because I realize that this is an extremely simplified example of a microservice. I also understand that my question doesn't contain any code or anything, so I apologize for that. I have researched for hours and can't seem to understand how to go about this. I really appreciate anybody's help!</p>&#xA;"

From my view, this is how it works: user -> frontend -> client service -> Spring Data REST endpoints (the microservice) -> DB.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is nice and all but when I get the endpoint response (from the RestTemplate), it contains hypermedia going directly to the microservice, and per se, you now can drive your way through the microservice while ignoring the load balancer, which, for me, kills the purpose of it. And if I've like 5 microservices scaling to each other, it means the user is now focusing into just one of a broad way of 5 microservice that are supposedly managed by load balancer.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Q1:</strong>&#xA;Is ok for an user to have that knowledge of the API (and then kinda killing part of the structure)?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Even if I add the links to the services detected by Eureka and delete the current endpoints to that microservice, those links aren't going to work and such means I'm chopping of the hypermedia links.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Q2:</strong>&#xA;Is there another approach to this? Through some kind of proxy, external load balancer, dns or something like that?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>P.D: I don't know if I'm being clear enough.

Those are the Eureka registered names.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where must go the @EnabledZuulProxy?

If I change that and use it in the microservice, then it keeps sending everything directed to the microservice to the client, even the request from the client, which ends up with a loop and then an error (timeout, load balancer full, circuit broken...) which is generally this though: <strong>com.netflix.zuul.exception.ZuulException: Forwarding error.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I finally got Zuul to work and understood what it does. Now, when I access my new gateway app, it forwards the request to my microservice and the resulting hypermedia is now pointing to that gateway, which is what I wanted.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem was initially architectural and then turned into a coding problem, but now I think am clear about this technologies.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The cup of tea was understanding what Zuul does, when and how it does it. @Ryan Baxter guideline and this two articles: <a href=""https://dzone.com/articles/microservice-architecture-with-spring-cloud-and-do"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dzone.com/articles/microservice-architecture-with-spring-cloud-and-do</a> and <a href=""https://spring.io/guides/gs/routing-and-filtering/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://spring.io/guides/gs/routing-and-filtering/</a> where fundamentals to get this done.

All the other information (name, contact, ...) are added by the import service (but can also be modified by the user).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>All in all the import service is totally useless without the information of the manager service, but also the manager service can only show the user specified channel information (worst case: only channel url) if no import service is available. In total: they depend heavily on each other.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So much for the general architecture. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem I have here is, that the import service depends on the data in the manager service database to such a great degree and also modifies it:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Would it be a good idea to share the manager service database between these two services or should it only be accessible by the provided API?</li>&#xA;<li>No matter if database is shared or not: both services need model classes for the channel.

Is that even the right way to go about this?</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Example 2:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Client facing web app makes GET request to <strong>/example/getStuff</strong></li>&#xA;<li>Microservice A api handles getStuff by sending <strong>stuffRequested</strong> event to kafka.</li>&#xA;<li>In order to get the data to return a ""stuff"" object, data is required from 2 external data sources.  Microservice B is in charge of handling these 2 data sources, so it consumes the <strong>stuffRequested</strong> event, gets the data from the 2 data sources, and sends <strong>stuffRequestCompleted</strong> event (with the ""stuff"" data in the payload) for microservice A to consume so it can return the ""stuff"" object to the client app.</li>&#xA;<li><strong>This where I am stuck</strong>: With all of this going on in the background asynchronously, how can I ""suspend"" sending back a response until I can consume <strong>stuffRequestCompleted</strong> and send back the requested data?</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you in advance.</p>&#xA;"

49890971,What are some best practices for deploying multiple microservices at the same time?,2018-04-18 04:00:43,<amazon-web-services><elastic-beanstalk><microservices><continuous-deployment>,1,64,2,0.0,0,"<p>I have been struggling with the best way to deploy multiple microservices at the same time if there is a change that affects more than one service.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>While I'd be interested in any general approaches, let me provide a specific example I'm running into.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our company uses AWS and Elastic Beanstalk to deploy microservice containers for a web site that are relatively decoupled. Right now our web application consists of:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>A SPA written in Angular, deployed and hosted in an S3 bucket (Call&#xA;it SPA)</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>A webapi service, written in .NET Core, dockerized, and deployed to&#xA;an elastic beanstalk application (Call it WebAPI) </p></li>&#xA;<li><p>An integration service, written in Node.JS, dockerized, and deployed&#xA;to an elastic beanstalk application (Call it IntService)</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The SPA and WebAPI talk via a REST API</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The WebAPI and IntService are loosely coupled and talk to each other through an AWS SQS Queue. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If we have a change to any one of these services, our deploy process is fairly straightforward. For example, if we have a change to the WebAPI, we spin up a new elastic beanstalk application environment, deploy there, then swap the URLs (so basic blue-green deployment).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm struggling with the right approach if there is a change that affects multiple services. For example, say there is a feature that requires changes to both WebAPI and IntService. Since each of these live in their own repo, they each have their own CI and CD pipelines independent of each other. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If just one service is deployed, the whole app might break. How do people handle this type of deploy? Do you clone both the WebAPI and IntService environments, deploy both of them, then swap both URLs, just making sure you do it at about the same time to minimize the window of time where only one service is active?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Alternatively, we were looking at using an API gateway. But would that mean every time we wanted to deploy we'd create a new API gateway stage? If we do that, is the blue-green deployment 'swap' actually happening in the API Gateway?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sorry if this is confusing, but I'm just trying to wrap my head around what I have to imagine is a fairly common problem with microservices.</p>&#xA;"

There’s no “blind” retry.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If the service has persistent connections from clients, then terminating the service might be a problem, other than that I think terminating the process is an approach to consider.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does anyone has any experiente that can share?

I've been looking into security and have added spring security to the web microservice for clients logging in.

It's pretty simple and just looks something like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>api/users?email=myemail@gmail.com&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This API has authorization associated with it because some users are allowed to know about other users and some are not.

Where as before I could JOIN this query and only have a single trip to a database. I now have 2 (or more depending on required data) requests to the db.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) Join in external service. Building out a seperate service that handles queries. - This feels a lot like having an internal api that every service is dependant on and seems like a bad practice as a single point of failure. Maybe i'm seeing this wrong.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>3) Join in mysql. Have all data in the same database and query as before. This has the benefit of single trip to mysql, however breaks the microservice approach and removes the ability to have database/schema per service.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I personally feel like option 1 is the most versatile option, but I'm curious about the added latency of multiple round trips, and how you guys have dealt with that.

I have read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When it comes to Azure, I understand there are many components like Azure Service Fabric, AKS and also have the option of deploying containers within Azure VMs using Docker or any other containerization tools. However, since Microservices is about developing atmoic individually scalable services, can this also be achieved by deploying each service as an Azure Web API APP within an App Service Plan and configure Auto-Scale based on Performance metrics (though each API APP may not be individually scalable, they can still be individually manageable in terms of deployment, configuration etc)? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can someone please suggest if this thought process is correct?</p>&#xA;"

Each microservice contains a keystore. In this keystore is the containing microservice’s private/public keypair, signed by a trusted certificate authority. Also in this keystore is the other two microservices’ public key certificates, exported from the source microservice’s signed/trusted keypair.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This implementation works, but something doesn’t quite smell right about it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Namely, every time I introduce a new microservice I must add a) each existing microservice’s public key certificate to its keystore, and b) the new microservice’s public key certificate to every other microservice (the assumption being the new microservice must communicate bi-directionally, and securely, with each existing microservice).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, repeat the above pattern for a second keypair, this one used to sign/verify authentication tokens supplied in REST calls.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am wondering if, instead of the above, it is a) advisable and b) safe to share a single trusted public key certificate between all microservices?

My partitioning strategy is to use the normalized international string format phone number to address a named service instance, and the hash of the phone number to resolve a partition of that service. EX: fabric:/myapp/users/1/718 (where the international phone number is +1718xxxxxxx) This allows me to geo-locate services based on their country (and further in the US/Canada markets by area code).  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is sort of theoretical, but also practical in nature.  <strong>Who owns the logic for service resolution?</strong>  A simple approach is to just require anyone taking a dependency on this service to know how its partitioned, but that feels like a leaky abstraction to me.  Furthermore, I would like to assign an Id to the user which is divorced from the concept of a phone number.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>My original approach was to make the Id a byte[] which included the service name, partition id, and local id of the user.  I dropped this idea since the size of the ID was very large, and would add up over time.  (this is problematic because all keys in a Reliable Dictionary need to fit into memory and I'd rather not kill a ton of memory on ids) Also, it still carries with it the baggage of everyone using the id knowing how to interpret the id and use it accordingly.</li>&#xA;<li>My next idea was to provide a client library to anyone consuming the service.  This also has the drawback of a binary dependency of a consuming service.  If i want to change the strategy in the future, I have to jump through a bunch of hoops to handle failures to correctly resolve the entity.</li>&#xA;<li>The last alternative i can think of is to have a stateless proxy in front of stateful service which handles the resolution for all services.  This is the most appealing from a design perspective but also involves managing, building another service just for resolution.  Not opposed to it, but it is an additional consideration.  If i go this route, should I tread this service as a separate service fabric application, or is it advisable to keep everything as one application. </li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I also, am open to entertaining the idea that partitioning users this way is a bad idea.

Resource server is an independent spring boot jar running in its container.<br/>&#xA;We have created several microservices using Spring Boot which are executable jars, deployed and running independently in their container. Resource server will protect end points exposed in these microservices. For that, I have created a RestController in resource server in which end point is exposed which will call the microservice end point when request comes in. for e.g <br/>&#xA;<b>Microservice.java</b> - Running at port 8080</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>@RequestMapping(""/getUser"")&#xA;public String getUserName(){&#xA;   return ""xyz"";&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p><b>Resource Server</b> - Running at port 8090 <br/>&#xA;ResourceServerController.java</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>@RequestMapping(""/userInfo"")&#xA;public String getUserName(){&#xA; // calling above microservice using rest template&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There can be several end point in a several microservices and as we have to protect them, is it right to proxy every end point in the rest controller of a resource server?

In this way, we do not need to proxy end points in the Rest Controller of Resource Server.<br/>&#xA;Just wanted to know the best way to Protect microservices using separate resource server.</p>&#xA;"

40927853,Two vertx instances isolated from each other,2016-12-02 08:36:19,<java><cluster-computing><microservices><vert.x>,1,52,0,0.0,0,"<p>we would like to isolate client related (in-browser apps) vertx services from backend (server side) ones. Is there a way how to create two separated (isolated) buses? That all server services would be able to communicate with each other normally, but frontend services must not be on the same bus (got internal events, messages). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I fould a classpath isolation (isolationGroup) feature, but it does not look like what we need.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We need all backend services could communicate with each other. But only one backend module will be accessible from outside and will work as security gate for outer-external communication with frontend modules. So, this gate module would subscribe all messages from internal bus and process it and send them to outer world... and oposite, would subscribe all outer messages and re-send them to internal bus for internal processing.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any idea?

I want to be able to easily call all the services from JS frontend without having to deal with domains. It would be great if I could just call <code>/services/service1/</code> and the fact I am on the same domain would keep me in the same environment.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So let's consider dev environment:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><code>dev.website.com/</code> -> goes to webapp</li>&#xA;<li><code>dev.website.com/services/service1/</code> -> goes to service1</li>&#xA;<li><code>dev.website.com/services/service1/</code> ...</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To be able to do that, I configured ingress as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    - path: /services/service1/*&#xA;      backend:&#xA;        serviceName: service1&#xA;        servicePort: 8080&#xA;    - path: /services/service2/*&#xA;      backend:&#xA;        serviceName: service2&#xA;        servicePort: 8080&#xA;    - path: /*&#xA;      backend:&#xA;        serviceName: webapp&#xA;        servicePort: 8080&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This would work great, but it doesn't.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>First issue is that the <code>service1</code> receives full path (<code>/services/service1</code>) instead of just <code>/</code> when being called. For that I found this: <code>ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /</code> - But I also foudn that this feature is not implemented, which is contradictory and doesn't make much sense.</li>&#xA;<li>Second problem is that, the order of the services is not followed and call on <code>/services/service1/</code> ends up in <code>webapp</code>.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this even a good approach? What is the best practice to do this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>According to suggestions I removed <code>*</code> from the path, which helped, but also removed necessary functionality. I need to be able to use:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><code>/en/</code> -> <code>webapp</code></li>&#xA;<li><code>/services/service1/method1</code> -> <code>service1</code></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This doesn't work without the <code>*</code> in path.</p>&#xA;"

I have placed an application on the cluster that contains three services, the application is configured such that an instance of each service will reside on each node.  Of the three services, one of them is a front-end service that receives requests from external clients and then communicates with the other two services (which are not addressible from outside of the cluster) to get the information needed for the response.  An external client program has been written to communicate with the front-end service via http requests.  Currently, this external client must send its request to a particular service instance using the node ip address and port.  The problem I am having with this approach is that if the node that is being addressed by the external client goes down, the client is no longer able to address the service although the front end service is still running on two other nodes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is my question:  Is there a way for the external client to call the front-end service through Service Fabric without specifying a specific node to communicate with?

Another might write a row to the database. etc. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I also have a small, secondary database, D_Small, that S1 (and only S1) is reading and writing to. I want to leave the small secondary database alone, but I want to change the way data is accessed from the big MySQL Database, D_Big.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to make it so that the only way to access the big MySQL database is through API calls to a second service, S2, which also has access to the big database.

Thus, I want to remove S1's direct dependency on D_Big.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What are some good ways to go about doing that? What are some tips/advice? The most straightforward way seems to be to replace every single API call in S1 that accesses D_Big directly with an API to a corresponding API in S2 that just performs the exact same database access that S1 would have performed directly. For example, imagine that we have these APIs in S1:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>API_1 returns columns [foo, bar, baz] from table1 in D_Big</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>API_2 writes value foo to table2 in D_Big</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>API_3 returns columns * from table3 in D_Big</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would just replace these with:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>API_1 in S1 calls corresponding API in S2 which returns columns [foo, bar, baz] from table1 in D_Big</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>API_2 in S1 calls corresponding API in S2 which API_2 writes value foo to table2 in D_Big</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>API_3 in S1 calls corresponding API in S2 which API_3 returns columns * from table3 in D_Big</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But what about cases where the ideal mapping isn't one to one? Like when you should combine APIs (ex. one API in S1 calls two different APIs in S2 to get the data it needs or two different APIs in S1 call the same API in S2 but with different parameters)? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How do you make a good interface decoupling two services from what used to be a shared data source (D_Big)? Assume that both S1 and S2 use a Java/XML/Spring based system to transfer data over API calls.</p>&#xA;"

This app runs on a web server that contains the monolithic set of APIs that the app could call (including user authentication). We want to expose an ""API"" (ex// gather data) for users to query a limited set of data about their account from their own code. This will allow them to write custom dashboards with the data we are collecting for them. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With this new API, API calls are now able to come from somewhere other than our web-ap. So we want to set up an API gateway to manage the request ""load"". For example, the gateway can limit a user's requests to once every ten minutes. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The end user will be given an API key to make requests through Kong and then Kong will carry out the API query for them using an HTTP GET/POST to the web server. Since our web-server is publicly available we need a way to verify that the request for the API (gather data) is only coming from Kong. I've done some research into JWTs and seems like a possible approach. Would it make sense to simply give the Kong server its own JWT issued by the web-server? Then any GET/POST to the web-server that doesn't have the Kong JWT are rejected.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know this might not be the most logical setup for an API gateway, normally you would have microservices on the same private network as Kong communicating with each other and wouldn't necessarily need to verify the authenticity of the requests coming in as Kong would be handling that.

The angular microservice is expected to communicate with the other microservice.&#xA;I saw many examples implementing this and its basically not a big deal. I am well aware of that. However, in all these examples I saw something like this in the angular microservice:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>this.http.get('http://....:8080....');&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At first I was just happy to get it running. However, right now I am wondering whether such implementations do not tightly couple the services to each other. In the http URL, we see the host and the port is also fix. That might work well in some cases, but, if our microservice e.g. chooses a port dynamically, we already have a problem right? Then we can't define the port in the other microservice in such a way. The same holds for the host information. If the microservice might be running on different hosts, we cannot always just define the host statically.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong. Is there any way we can abstract away from these details, i.e. the host or the port but is there another way to find this out dynamically? Or are there other good alternatives for the communication between microservices that don't imply this problem?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I saw examples of services using a service registry. By means of this, we can abstract away from this a bit - no? Is this the only possibility? I am not sure whether this is relevant here, but so far I'm using Spring Boot to implement my microservices.</p>&#xA;"

I would like to be able to run these emulators from the main project root, as opposed to having to check out their repository and run from that directory.

Currently the problem I've been running into is that each microservice is calling other microservices directly for data which seems to be tightly coupling them and is outlined in the following article:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=""https://thenewstack.io/synchronous-rest-turns-microservices-back-monoliths/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://thenewstack.io/synchronous-rest-turns-microservices-back-monoliths/</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So event driven architecture seems to help with the overall design but where I get confused at is how would a GET request work for data if the API that is called needs data from another service? Would it post a request into a bus and subscribe for an answer? Do you just have to wait then for a response possibly delaying the response to the consumer? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or is this a case where you would need to call another API directly? Any resources would be very much appreciated.</p>&#xA;"

The authentication app will then act as an API gateway.</li>&#xA;<li>Other is the one which you mentioned (missing of queues). All request lands on to the authentication service app (how ? can be URL redirection) and then this writes to individual queue dedicated to each service , where each service subscribes to it specific queue. </li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"

Same as above, queue would help reduce http calls. Also would need a queue to report status back to batch service.</li>&#xA;<li>Duplicate some logic by having batch service do it's own validation and inserts/updates, but then fire a user created event or user updated event so modules/features in the main app can deal with the changes.</li>&#xA;<li>Embed the batch processing service into the main application</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Other details:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>The batch service and web application are both clustered</li>&#xA;<li>Both are running on AWS, so I have tools like SQS and SNS easily accessible</li>&#xA;<li>Java 1.7 applications</li>&#xA;<li>Tomcat containers</li>&#xA;<li>Main application is Grails</li>&#xA;<li>Batch service uses Spring Batch and Quartz at it's core</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question is what are accepted ways to avoid duplication of business logic based on the details above?

26218391,Testing reusable components / services across multiple systems,2014-10-06 14:26:05,<testing><components><agile><platform><microservices>,1,84,0,1.0,1,"<p>I'm currently starting a new project where we are hoping to develop a new system using reusable components and services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We currently have 30+ systems that all have common elements, but at the moment we develop each system in isolation so it feels like we are often duplicating code and then of course we have 30+ separate code bases to maintain and support.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What we would like to do is create a generic platform using shared components to enable quick development of new collections, reusing code and reusing automated tests and reduce the code base that needs to be maintained.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our thoughts so far are that we would have a common code base for specific modules for example User Management and Secure System Access, these modules could consist of their own generic web module, API and Context.  This would create a generic package of code.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We could then deploy these different components/packages  to build up a new system to save coding the same modules over and over again, so if the new system needed to manage users, you could get the User Management package and boom it does what you need.  However, because we have 30+ systems we will deploy the components multiple times for each collection.  Also we appreciate that some of the systems will need unique functionality so there would be the potential to add extensions to the generic modules for system specific needs OR to choose not to use one of the generic modules and create a new one, but use the rest of the generic components.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example if we have 4 generic components that make up the system A, B, C and D.  These could be deployed to create the following system set ups:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>System 1 - A, B, C and D (Happy with all generic components)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>System 2 - Aa, B, C and D (extended component A to include specific functionality)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>System 3 - A, E, C and F (Can't reuse components B and D so create specific ones, but still reuse components A and C)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is throwing up a few issues for me as I need to be able to test this platform and each system to ensure it works and this is the first time I've come across having to test a set up like this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've done some reading around Mircroservices and how to test them, but these often approach the problem for just 1 system using microservices where we are looking at multiple systems with different configurations.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My thoughts so far lead me to believe that for the generic components that will be utilised by the different collections I can create automated tests at the base code level and then those tests will confirm the generic functionality and therefore it will not be necessary to retest these functions again for each component, other than perhaps a manual sense check after deployment.  Then at each system level additional automated tests can be added to check the specific functionality that may be created.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Ideally what I'd like would be to have some sort of testing platform set up so that if a change is made to a core component such as User Management it would be possible to trigger all the auto tests at the core level and then all of the specific system tests for all systems that will share the component to ensure that any changes don't affect core functionality or create a knock on effect to the specific systems.  Then a quick manual check would be required.  I'm keen to try and remove a massive manual test overhead checking 30+ systems each time a shared component is changed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We work in an agile way and for our current projects we have a strong continuous integration process set up, so when a developer checks in some code (Visual Studio) this triggers a CI build (TeamCity / Octopus) that will run all of the unit tests, provided that all these tests pass, this then triggers an Integration build that will run my QA Automated tests which are a mixture of tests run at an API level and Web tests using SpecFlow and PhantomJS or Selenium Webdriver.  We would like to keep this sort of framework in place to keep the quick feedback loops.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It all sounds great in theory, but where I'm struggling is trying to put something into practice and create a sound testing strategy to cover this kind of system set up.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So really what I'm hoping is that there is someone out there who has encountered something similar in the past and has thoughts on the best way to tackle this and has proven that they work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm keen to get a better understanding of how I could set up a testing platform / rig to aid the continuous integration for all systems considering that each system could potentially look different, yet have shared code.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any thoughts or links to blogs / whitepapers etc. that you think might help would be much appreciated!!</p>&#xA;"

The drawback is that this data is not changing very frequently, asking by HTTP is not that cheap and there is a lot of traffic to this let's say global registry service. As it is not changing very often, many services could just cache the data - in order to not ask for it every time - and not be able to respond to change quick enough when the change is made to the configuration.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The other solution could be to externalize such configuration - in AWS for example there could be some configuration file on S3 that would be available for others. The drawback here is that there is no way (as far as I know) to track changes in such file and there is no way to add some logic for verification if changed value in configuration is correct (there is no typos and so on), etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question is how to handle global configuration/registry in microservice world so that there is little HTTP overhead, you can audit changes as well as introduce change at the same time in many services?</p>&#xA;"

I implemented a couple of web APIs using microservices architecture. I am trying to make my microservices accessible via HTTPS. The microservices are developed using .net core, so according to Microsoft document, to enforce HTTPS, I need to configure Kestrel. Following is how I did it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>.UseKestrel(options =&gt;&#xA;            {&#xA;                options.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 5000);&#xA;                options.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 5001, listenOptions =&gt;&#xA;                {&#xA;                    listenOptions.UseHttps(""cert.pfx"", ""pwd"");&#xA;                });&#xA;            }) &#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To make it simple, I use kestrel by itself and skip reverse proxy. I will certainly include Nginx as reverse proxy but that is the future work. I tested locally, it worked. Then, I deployed it onto Docker. Here is the docker-compose.override file</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>version: '3.4'&#xA;&#xA;services:&#xA;dataservice:&#xA;  environment:&#xA;    - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development&#xA;    - ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:443;http://+:80&#xA;  ports:&#xA;    - ""5000:80""&#xA;    - ""5001:443""&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In dockerfile, port 5000 and 5001 are exposed. I built the project into images, and run it on docker, using <code>docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80  --name *name* *imagename*</code>. Docker shows <code>Now listening on: http://127.0.0.1:5000</code> and <code>Now listening on: https://127.0.0.1:5001</code>. Now the problem is, leave the https part aside, the APIs cannot even accessed by http. The browser just shows <code>This page isn’t working 127.0.0.1 didn’t send any data. ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE</code>. I found a similar question from here <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40827230/docker-cannot-open-port-from-container-to-host"">Docker: cannot open port from container to host&#xA;</a>, somehow this is about server should listen to 0.0.0.0. Though I am not fully understand the reason, I changed the kestrel  configuration to</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>options.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5000);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>built and ran docker images again, and Docker shows <code>Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:5000</code>, still it doesn't work. I also tried to replace the IP with <code>localhost</code>, it has no use. I did not use <code>.UseHttpsRedirection()</code>, https should have nothing to do with the problem. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I missing any configuration or doing anything wrong? It would be really helpful if anyone could shed some light. Thank you in advance.</p>&#xA;"

Is that a valid one? Do you have some practical experiece with one of those approaches?

In the basic setup, the aggregate reads events and commands from two kafka topics. Then, it writes new events to that first topic and processing results in a third topic. Therefore, Kafka acts as the event store. Hope this drawing helps:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>  RPC Request                              RPC Result&#xA;  |                                                 |&#xA;  ~~~~&gt; Commands-|              |---&gt; Results ~~~~~~|&#xA;                 |--&gt;Aggregate--|&#xA;  ~&gt; Input evs. -|              |---&gt; output evs. ~~~&#xA;  |                                                 |&#xA;  ~~~~~&lt;~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;~~~feedbak loop~~~~~&lt;~~~~~~~~&lt;~~~&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Due to the fact that Kafka is not checkpoined, commands could potentially be replayed twice and it seems that output events could also be written twice the topic. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How could the state be recovered in those cases with repeated messages? Is it possible for the aggregate to know when its input streams are up-to-date to start processing commands?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h1>My thoughts</h1>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have thought several solutions:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>If Flink implements a rollback unconfirmed events, a Sink could be implemented which will get the current offset from the event source. When restarted, this sink would remove newer-than-offset events in kafka topic. It his way, KafkaSource and KafkaSink would be generated from the same builder and then exposed to the topology. This solution has a strong problem given that other services could read the newer events in the topic and cause inconsistency.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>If removing events from Flink is not possible in 2, the statefull source could potentially read events from the offset and try to match the repeated events in the aggregate and drop them. This options seems not robust as there can be situations where patches are not deterministic and subject to flaws as it should be rethought for each aggregate and topology and it would not warranty recovery (e.g. in case of consecutive restarts). Therefore this is a bad solution.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>A different approach is this one. It is to create a special KafkaSource with two special watermarks: First one, KafkaSourceStartedWatermark, will be always sent at source startup to notify dependant operators. When this watermark is sent, the source internally records the current Kafka offset. Second one, KafkaSourceUpToDateWatermark, is sent by the source when the offset is reached. These watermarks would travel along the topology transparently.

Comments?)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I ran <code>sbt dist</code> to create a zip file and then unzipped it and ran the executable in there. Interestingly, the zip was created within the service1-impl folder. So, if I have multiple modules (services?), will sbt dist create individual zip files for each of the service?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I run the executable created via <code>sbt dist</code>, it tries to connect to Cassandra and also launches a service locator and ignores the static service locator configuration that I added. Basically, looks like it ignores the lines I added to build.sbt.

When called service is up then normal code would be called. Of course with Hystrix I can additionally monitor this, but what else it gives me ?.

The ones I know about are Spring, Guava EventBus and Reactor. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is about what are good use cases where someone would want to use them instead of sending messages to a full fledged broker. I understand that its usage allows for a better decoupling of the business logic but in a microservices architecture you would normally publish events to be consumed by other microservices. The advantage of that is the failure tolerance you have by adding a cluster of brokers where an erroneous message cause by a failure in an instance can be retried by another one. Implementing logic that is decomposed and executed by sending messages that are later consumed by the same system, specially when the subscribers are executed in different threads, seems to me difficult to then put the data back to a consistent state.</p>&#xA;"

Let's introduce <strong>ResponseC</strong> class in both micro-services, but then somehow I find this a bit against maintainability, because of code duplication.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Common logic</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Both <strong>ServiceA</strong> and <strong>ServiceB</strong> communicates with <strong>ServiceC</strong>. When communicating with <strong>ServiceC</strong> we intend to have some policy regarding read and connection timeout and regarding the maximum number of retries. These values are configurable and there is also some common parts in the retry logic to be able to read the relevant values from the configuration file and to wrap the http calls. &#xA;The question is pretty much the same like in the previous case, because I either put these classes into a shared library or I basically introduce the same classes in both <strong>ServiceA</strong> and <strong>ServiceB</strong>. These classes are quite simple and generic, so at the moment I cannot imagine, that these classes will change frequently.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the question is, that what is better in these cases, duplicate code and having independent micro-services or introduce a shared library which makes these services dependent?</p>&#xA;"

This request will contain an opaque/reference token which the firewall sends to an authorization server.  The authorization server responds with a value token containing all the session information for the user.  The firewall then passes the request along with the value token to the API, and the value token will then get propagated to all the different microservices required to fulfill the request. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have 2 questions:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>How should updates to the session information in the value token be handled? To elaborate, when the session info in a token gets updated, it needs to be updated in the authorization server.  Should each service that changes the token talk to the authorization server? </li>&#xA;<li>Should all the microservices use this single token to store their session info? Or would it be better for each service to have a personalized token? If it's the latter, please explain how to adjust the design.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"

36265833,Microservices & Versioning,2016-03-28 15:50:24,<cloud><versioning><microservices><semantic-versioning><continuous-delivery>,3,353,0,0.0,1,"<p>I'm building a cloud-native application using microservices. Eventually I have arrived at the point where I must implement proper versioning for my microservices. In most places where I've looked everyone is talking about semantic versioning these days (in general, not just for microservices).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One of the principals of a microservices architecture is to <em>never deliver a breaking changeset</em>. On the other hand, semantic versioning says that one should increase the major version number when a non-backwards compatible (read ""breaking"") changeset is delivered. How are these compatible?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It seems to me that semantic versioning <em>might be</em> overkill for a microservices architecture. If all public APIs are versioned (example /api/v3/getSomething) then do I really need full semantic versioning? I'm considering a scheme whereby I use a single number to identify the API version currently available (v1, v2, v3 etc.) together with a build number (or perhaps date/timestamp) that identifies the continuous integration pipeline that produced the build. Note that v3 would also still support v2 API calls until everyone using the service has moved to using v3, so v3 is the ""target version"" in a sense. So my microservice foo would look like ""foo-v3-20160503142209.jar""</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Are there any obvious pitfalls to this? The way I see it, clients will be guaranteed that the API is compatible if I enforce <em>never delivering breaking changeset</em> (if it changes, it is a new API version). And clients can be sure of all latest bug fixes by using the latest build number/timestamp.</p>&#xA;"

But my experience mostly been on monolithic architectures I can't come up with a specific solution.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I have thought as of now is like...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Data Layer -</strong> This is where all the Code First entities resides along with DBContext.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Business Layer -</strong> This is where all the Service Managers would be performing and enforcing the Business Logic i.e. UserManager (IUserManager), OrderManager (IOrderManager), InvoiceManager (IInvoiceManager) etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>WebAPI (Self Hoted Inside Service Fabric) -</strong> Although this WebAPI is inside Service Fabric but does nothing except to receive the request and call respectic Services under Service Fabric. WebAPI Layer would also do any Authentication and Authorization (ASP.NET Identity) before passing on the call to other services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Service Fabric Services -</strong> UserService, OrderService, InvoiceService. These services are invoked from WebAPI Layer and DI the Business Layer (IUserManager, IOrderManager, IInvoiceManager) to perform it's operation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Do you think this is okay to proceed with?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One theoretical issue though, while reading up for several microservices architecture resources, I found that, all of them suggests to have Business Logic inside the service so that the specific service can be scaled independently. So I believe, I'm violating the basic aspect of microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm doing this because, the customer requirement is to use this Business Layer across several projects, such as Batch Jobs (Azure Web Jobs), Backend Dashboard for Internal Employees (ASP.NET MVC) etc. So If I don't keep the Business Layer same, I have to write the same Business Logic again for Web Jobs and Backend Dashboard which I feel is not a good idea. As a simple change in Business Logic would require change in code at several places then.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One more concern is, in that case, I have to go with Service to Service communication for ACID transactions. Such as, while creating an Order, a Order and Invoice both must be created. So in that case, I thought of using Event Driven programming i.e. Order Service will emit an event which the Invoice Service can subscribe to, to create Invoice on creation of Order. But the complications are if the Invoice Service fails to create invoice, it can either keep trying do that infinitely (which is a bad idea I think), or emit another event to Order Service to subscribe and roll back the order. There can be lots of confusion with this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, I must mention that, we are using a Single Database as of now.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my questions are...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>What issue do you see with my approach? Is it okay?</li>&#xA;<li>If not, please suggest me a better approach. You can guide me to some resources for implementation details or conceptual details too.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>NOTE :</strong> The requirement of client is, they can scale specific module in need. Such as, UserService might not be used much as there won't be many signups daily or change in User Profile, but OrderService can be scaled along as there can be lots of Orders coming in daily. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'll be glad to learn.

46110222,What's the recommended way to handle microservice processing bugs new insights?,2017-09-08 06:45:56,<asynchronous><message-queue><microservices>,1,44,0,0.0,1,"<p>Before I get to my question, let me sketch out a sample set of microservices to illustrate my dilemma.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Scenario outline</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Suppose I have 4 microservices:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>An <strong>activation service</strong> where features supplied to our customers are (de)activated. A <strong>registration service</strong> where members can be added and changed. A <strong>secured key service</strong> that is able to generate secure keys (in a multi step process) for members to be used when communicating with them with the outside world. And a <strong>communication service</strong> that is used to communicate about our members with external vendors.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The <strong>secured key service</strong> may however only request secured keys if this is a feature that is activated. Additionally, the <strong>communication service</strong> may only communicate about members that have a secured key AND if the communication feature itself is activated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Because they are microservices, each of the services has it's own datastore and is completely self sufficient. That is, any data that is required from the other microservices is duplicated locally and kept in sync by means of asynchronous messages from the other microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>The dilemma</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm actually facing two main dilemma's. The first is (pretty obviously) data synchronization. When there are multiple data stores that need to be kept in sync you have to account for messages getting lost or processed out of order. But there are plenty of out of the box solutions for this and when all fails you could even fall back to some kind of ETL process to keep things in sync.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The main issue I'm facing however is the actions that need to be performed. In the above example the <strong>secured key service</strong> must perform an action when it either </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Receives a message from the <strong>registration service</strong> for a new member when it already knows that the <em>secured keys</em> feature is active in the <strong>activation service</strong></li>&#xA;<li>Receives a message from the <strong>activation service</strong> that the <em>secured keys</em> feature is now active when it already knows about members from the <strong>registration service</strong></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In both cases this means that a message from the external system must lead to both an update in the local copy of the data as well as some logic that needs to be processed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>The question</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now to the actual question :)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is the recommended way to cope with either bugs or new insights when it comes to handling those messages? Suppose there is a bug in the message handler from the <strong>activation service</strong>. The handler does update the internal data structure, but it fails to detect that there are already registered members and thus never starts the <em>secure key generation</em> process. Alternatively it could be that there's no bug, but we decide that there is something else we want the handler to do.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The system will have no reason to resubmit or reprocess messages (as the message didn't fail), but there's no real way for us to re-trigger the behavior that's behind the message.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I hope it's clear what I'm asking (and I do apologize if it should be posted on any of the other 170 Stack... sites, I only really know of StackOverflow)</p>&#xA;"

Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one element has of another. So a change to one service should not require a change to another.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With a shared database (as in not decoupled) architecture both these principles are not covered. This due to the following facts:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>There is a fixed link between the users and the specific technology&#xA;choice as well as to the actual database implementation.</li>&#xA;<li>Businiess/application logic might be spread among multiple users.</li>&#xA;<li>Shared information which needs to be edited can trigger a change of&#xA;the behavior in multiple places.</li>&#xA;<li>Due to the more monolithic architecture which goes with shared&#xA;databases a failure can effect many serveries since they are all tied&#xA;together, even a compelte system failure can happen due to the&#xA;coupeling.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To avoid the above mentioned issues: decoupled databases can be used with microservices instead of shared databases. So each microservice should have its own database. This will also ease scaling of the system, provide much much more system availability, since ""only"" the one, really effected service will fail. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: &#xA;One other benefit of microservices would be that it can improve the flexibility and speed of development.

However, I'm a little bit confused about how I go from issuing a command to performing a query to return the new state, specifically with regard to interactions with a web API gateway.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As an example, the simple application I am attempting to write (which probably doesn't actually need any of these; it is just something to aid my learning) creates a random-graph and then performs some long-running calculations on the graph. I've modelled this as two separate services: the <code>GraphService</code> and the <code>ComputationService</code>. The imagined process flow is as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>User requests new random graph.</li>&#xA;<li>API gateway constructs <code>CreateGraph</code> command and sends it to the&#xA;<code>graph service</code>.</li>&#xA;<li><code>GraphService command handler</code> creates a graph and publishes a&#xA;<code>GraphCreated</code> event.</li>&#xA;<li><code>GraphService event handler</code> subscribes to topic for graph events,&#xA;processes <code>GraphCreated</code> event and stores graph in persistent read&#xA;storage.</li>&#xA;<li><strong>Client somehow gets the newly created graph.</strong></li>&#xA;<li><code>ComputationService event handler</code> subscribes to topic for graph&#xA;events, processes <code>GraphCreated</code> event and begins potentially&#xA;long-running computation, e.g. calculate diameter.</li>&#xA;<li><code>ComputationService</code> publishes <code>DiameterComputed</code> event.</li>&#xA;<li><code>GraphService</code> event handler subscribes to topic for computation&#xA;events, processed <code>DiameterComputed</code> event and updates the graph in&#xA;persistent read storage.</li>&#xA;<li>Client somehow gets updated - easier than getting the new graph, since already have an ID and can poll for changes / websockets / SSE, etc.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>That seems relatively simple. However, my confusion lies in how to go about informing the API gateway, and thus the web client, of the new graph (as highlighted in bold above). In a typical CRUD process, the result of the <code>POST request</code> to create a new graph would be to return the URL of the new resource, for instance. However, with CQRS, commands should return nothing or an exception.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How do I pass information back to the client of the service (in this case the API gateway) about the ID of the new graph so that it can perform a query to get the representation of the new resource and send it to the user? Or at least get an ID so that the web client can ask the API gateway, etc?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As I see it at the moment, after sending a command, everyone is just left hanging. There needs to be some sort of subscription model that can be interrogated for the status of the graph creation. I considered having the API gateway generate a request ID which gets embedded with the <code>CreateGraph</code> command, but this then couples the service to the API.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm obviously missing something, but have no idea what. None of the examples I've looked at or discussions I've read address this issue and assume that the ID of whatever resource is already known. I couldn't find any discussions here addressing this issue, but if I've just missed them, please point me there rather than duplicating questions. Any pointers would be hugely welcomed.</p>&#xA;"

So the subscribe request object may contain a list of topic names and information sufficient  enough for the service to send notifications to the subscribing client when a message is published to one of the subscribed topics.   </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It's also important to note that the service is agnostic to the content of these messages, and that is separately commnuicated between publishers and subscribers. The service just needs to pass some encoding of a published message to all subscribers and they know how to decode it.<br>&#xA;Suppose also that clients who wish to subscribe via this endpoint require a SUBSCRIBER role.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now let's say that I want the service to provide a new, topic monitoring functionality: a client of this new functionality still needs to specify a list of topic names and the means to notify it, but this kind of service:<br>&#xA;1) would send meta-data notifications about the topics of interest. These notifications would convey meta-data information about topics such as: ""subscriber x has been disconnected from topic y"", or ""subscriber v subscribed to topic q"", or ""the number of subscribers on topic z just dropped below 3"", or ""there have been less than 5 notifications sent to topic w in the last hour""<br>&#xA;2) clients of this service require a MONITOR role.<br>&#xA;3) Note that the messages in these notifications would be system-defined messages. So their susbcribers could receive a service-defined object representing the message data (e.g. event type, subscriber id, topic name, etc').</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are two ways of handing this:<br>&#xA;A new endpoint may be created for the monitoring service, e.g. ""/messaging/monitor"", with same request object information as the existing subscribe endpoint, and perhaps additional parameters.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Alternatively, the existing endpoint may be overloaded to handle both subscribe and monitor requests, where the difference is conveyed in additional parameters. For example, the client could specify a boolean attribute, named ""monitor"", in the request object.

The account service holds the accounts and are always connected to a bank using a bankId.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The dilemma is how to handle and validate this relationship and bankId and the pros and cons that comes with each decision.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Option 1:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Ignore validating completely. POST/PATCH against Accounts will never validate if the given BankId is an existing ID.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Pros</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Services don't know about each other and there are no hard dependencies between them, if one service goes down, the other doesn't stop working. (Which is a BIG one)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Cons</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>If the BankId is incorrect, accounts are ""lost"" and can't be accessed.</li>&#xA;<li>The reporting service and/or any reader has to account for missing or incorrect banks and present whatever data it has without crashing.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Reflection</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The services are completely decoupled which will benefit performance, up time and complexity. All readers and applications need to be ""reactive"" and able to handle when cross service relationships are ""broken"".</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Option 2:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Always validate using synchronous REST-call. POST/PATCH against Accounts will fail if BankId does not exist or if in anyway BankService can't respond or is broken.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Pros</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>100% data integrity.</li>&#xA;<li>Readers don't need to handle and expect broken relationships.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Cons</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Services are tightly dependent, you could argue that they are no longer proper micro services and might as well be a single service.</li>&#xA;<li>Performance impacted negatively</li>&#xA;<li>AccountService POST/PATCH won't work if BankService is down, GET will still work.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Reflection</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Services are tightly dependent which is really bad, this is more like the ""old ways"" and generally I feel like it's the wrong way to do it. Merging the services in this case is even worse, if you start fixing problems by merging you'd probably keep doing it and soon end up with massive services and you've failed with the whole micro service principle. Sure, reads will still work but that's a far fetched excuse.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Option 3:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Keep a readonly copy of BankEntity in AccountService. AccountService keeps this updated via the event bus. Validate against this on POST/PATCH.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Pros</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>100% data integrity.</li>&#xA;<li>Readers don't need to handle and expect broken relationships.</li>&#xA;<li>No measurable negative performance impact</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Cons</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Complexity increased</li>&#xA;<li>Due to the asynchronous nature of events we cannot assume that the readonly copy of Banks are 100% updated. POST/PATCH on Account in rapid succession after creating a BankEntity might fail.</li>&#xA;<li>AccountService gets more knowledge of other services, even though it's a loose dependency</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Reflection</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the most complex way, readers won't need to handle broken relationships and the performance / up time-issues are resolved, however, instead you would have to handle the fact that the readonly copy of Banks might not be updated yet and try again later. Comparing this to Option 1 means you'd still have to deal with it in some way, and since this will be more complex across the board I'd say its not the most favourable one.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>End Thoughts</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The general goal that would be nice to achieve is that the services do not synchronously talk to each other and that data integrity is a good as possible.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, in a micro service architecture I'm under the impression that relationship integrity simply might be one of those things you accept to lose going to this way.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our decision is leaning towards Option 1, actually just ignoring it, and anytime where you need to use it, you have to expect and handle that it might not be correct. This seems like it is the most ""micro services"" solution, the services don't really know about each other, the only ones that do are applications and reporting services that need to do cross-service operations.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any of the services need to take full responsibility that they, at any given time, has all the data they need to fully function themselves. Let's say for arguments sake that AccountEntity NEEDED a location for whatever reason to be a usable and complete domain entity, you can't expect to rely on BankId, you'd have to store Location on AccountEntity and maybe if it changes, you'd get an event and you can update it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>&#xA;What are your experiences, opinions and thoughts on this? What would you do? Which strategy would you go for?</p>&#xA;"

It has a <code>service discovery</code> that uses <code>Eureka</code> and all users' requests go through an <code>API gateway</code> to reach the different microservices in an internal network. All these microservices, included the gateway, use the <code>Zuul</code> proxy. The <code>Authorization Service</code> will be another microservice storing the users in its own database. There is a frontend that at the moment is deployed in the gateway and is developed in <code>Angular 4</code>. There isn't any external apps that make requests to our system and there will be a bunch of users with a small set of possible roles that will make use of it and that will have to log in using a username and password. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In this situation, should we go for the <code>Authentication Code grant</code> or the <code>Password grant</code> would be ok? Or maybe not <code>Oauth2</code> at all? All the examples I've seen and read about that use the <code>Authentication Code grant</code> require the user to allow the client to get access to the resource after log in. In our case, the client will be the gateway so the user shouldn't have to grant it anything. The <code>Password grant</code> seems to remove this situation as the user's credentials serve to tell the <code>Authorization Service</code> to provide a token. Am I missing something?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Apart from that, examples of <code>Authorization Services</code> include <code>Facebook</code> or <code>Google</code>. When using these, once the user grants the client application access to the resource after log in, subsequent requests don't show this screen and they only need to log in with their credentials. Where is this access granted information stored? How does <code>Facebook</code> know that, once the user has granted access to a resource to an application, next time he logs in he doesn't need to do it again?</p>&#xA;"

New entries end up in the database, old ones are discarded (since they are already in the collection).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The service also exposes a GET endpoint, to which users connect.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, this is fine when I run a single instance of the service, but not so nice when I have multiple instances (probably it does not make sense for all instances to query the data service every three hours and discard most of the result). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have the following ideas how to solve this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Use some kind of leader election algorithm, only the leader should query the third party service</li>&#xA;<li>Separate the service into two: one smaller service would query the data (still problematic with several instances), put the result on a message queue so it's guaranteed that only one consumer takes and processes that result</li>&#xA;<li>Combine the first two ideas: leader election for the querying service, message queues for consuming data</li>&#xA;<li>Use some kind of distributed lock (I am aware of a solution with Redis/Jedis) so only one service does the querying. This, however feels a bit of an overkill; adding Redis just for locking is like...meh...</li>&#xA;<li>A much better, other idea, commonly used in such cases :-)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Could you please let me know if there is a preferred solution to such problems?</p>&#xA;"
50310975,Microservices and duplicating database tables,2018-05-12 21:53:39,<microservices>,2,31,0,1.0,1,"<p>I have been working on splitting up a monolithic system (.NET) into smaller bounded contexts and thus multiple class libraries. Address records are central to the system, so its important for the unrelated entities to reach back to a MASTER address record. Each microservice has its own database with tables related to that bounded context. I've run across a challenge with regard to Address records or the Address Entity. Both of these bounded contexts or libraries need the use of an Address table and the related lookup tables, such as State, Country, etc. Should I duplicate the Address related tables in each database and also duplicate the Address related domain classes? If I duplicate, I will have a ton of duplicate address records in both databases and this has me stuck. If I put the Address tables in something like a ""Location Service"", it will be difficult to display address fields in search results. Maybe this isn't the proper scenario for microservices?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EXAMPLE:&#xA;Microservice-1 (product A)&#xA;Incident -> one to one -> Address</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Microservice-2 (product B)&#xA;Fire Hydrant -> one to one -> Address</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Microservice-3 (product C)&#xA;Inspection -> many to one -> Address</p>&#xA;"

Besides that, we use a load balancer which enables us to duplicate heavy used services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We understand that microservices should be loosely coupled if coupling is needed at all. Also, the coupling should not happen on the database, but preferably by API's (REST).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Well, we use the microservice idea. We don't apply everthing that is recommended. In our case we use loosely coupled Tomcat War's that communicate via REST and JMS messaging. All webapps use the same database server, but they all have their own scheme (so no integration).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We have two issues with this approach:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>75% of the services generate report data. There is a report service that is responsible for persistence and serving of that data. So all services that generate report data send their findings to the report-service. In fact, each &#xA;service has it's own responsibility, but still we need all this communication. This seems to conflict with the microservices idea. It is like a horizontal layer that binds all vertical microservices together.</li>&#xA;<li>Due to the 'horizontal' coupling above, we also share interface objects. Report data is structured in a certain way. And every service needs to follow that structure. We have a strong feeling that shared libraries of domain / interface objects is against some principles. But as you will understand, duplicating all interface objects seems dumb and still a lot of work when interfaces change.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>An alternative to the current architecture is that every service persists it's own report data. Then you only need the communication when the report is rendered. In that case we don't have the regular communication between services and the report-service. Disadvantages are now that every service needs it's database layer (there was no), and that you still need to share report structures among all services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The high-level question is: is there a pattern for dividing services when behaviour can be separated horizontally and vertically?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The same issue may occur in a sales application where the 'product' plays a central role through the entire set of services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Should we redesign the architecture? Is there a pattern we can use? or is this an already known anti-pattern?</p>&#xA;"

So the warehosue entities holds keys to the customers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In front of those two microservices there is an API gateway. Now when showing a screen with warehouses we need also the information about the customers from the customer service.

Is it a better way to hold the customers with specific attributes also in the warehouse service? But this is just necessary for view/UI specific use cases?

This has the consequence that you consume your own messages and have to filter them. I would consider this a dirty solution, but easy for new new consumers to get all unit status events.</li>&#xA;<li>Create a specific topic for each status, for example <code>unit-status-created</code>, <code>unit-status-packaged</code>, <code>unit-status-loaded</code>, <code>unit-status-deleted</code>, etc. Each service produces only on it's own topic, but can consume from a list of topics, excluding it's own. For example the loading service would consume from list(<code>unit-status-created</code>, <code>unit-status-deleted</code>, <code>unit-status-packaged</code>). This allows services to show interest in only specific events, but it requires a code or config change in potentially all service when a new status topic is added. </li>&#xA;<li>Give each status it's own partition and consume from all partitions except the one you produce in. This design makes things more complicated (bookkeeping which partition contains a specific status), does not auto balance when partitions are added, adding partitions while live makes things a bit more risky, therefore does not have my preference. </li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"

The most popular SSO project is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Authentication_Service"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CAS</a>, which needs a CAS Server in the center, and a CAS Client before each web application. Unfortunately, it seems that there's not any offical CAS clients written in Golang, except <a href=""https://github.com/go-cas/cas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">go-cas/cas</a>, and <a href=""https://github.com/adanteng/cas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adanteng/cas</a>, which supports Beego.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But the workflow of CAS is a little bit complicated: too many redirections, too many tickets transmitted among the CAS, web apps, and the user browser.

Should that association be made in the security micro-service, or in the user micro-service? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My initial thought is in the security micro-service since that is where all applications will request the security information from. With that, and that a <code>user</code> can only be assigned to one <code>group</code>, I then come up with the endpoint of:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>/users/{id}/group      GET, POST, DELETE&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But that endpoint feels like it belongs more in the user micro-service.

I thought of two ways. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>Create a next version endpoint in the same server,(in spring using RequestMaping(""/v1/api1""),RequestMaping(""/v2/api1"") something like this.)</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Other wise completely run the v2 APIs in new server instance but keep the same API endpoint footprint and use AWS APIGateway as a proxy and configure the versioning there, then route to old server and new server depending on the version number in the request.</p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But the first approach will lead to lot of code duplication and code management messy I believe.

I read a lot about it, and there are tons of obscure areas where it's specific to the project built, but one area seems to get everyone to agree, microservices need to have isolated persistence or another way to say it, they need to have they own database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I love the idea, that means every microservice has its own database schema, its own domain objects and is 100% independent of any other microservice data structure.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are things I don't quite understand though.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The ""Customer Service"" is obviously central to the application, and we can see that basically any other microservice will need some data about the user at some point. Whether it'd be the user's credit amount, its ID, or its name.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But since other microservices can't directly read into the Customer Service database, they'll need to query this service over and over again. This is fine (I guess) for simple stuff like getting the name of current logged user, but when we need to display 60 users on a page and we can't do any SQL join, it feels like we're missing something. This is even worse when microservices depend upon tons of microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I found out that some people actually queried microservices X times a day to get data into their own microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So if microservice ""Search"" needs data from ""Product"", ""Customer"", it'll actually query these microservices and will persist the data with its own data structure.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The question I have is should it be ""Search"" that queries ""Product"" and ""Customer"", or should ""Product"" and ""Customer"" send data to ""Search"" ?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The first option looks a bit easier to do, we only need to have this logic on one side, and that's where the data is needed. But we'll only get static freshness of data which is not very smart, but could definitely work.&#xA;The second option looks a bit more difficult but more scalable too, because we could have very fresh data when we need it, since the data changed where it's sent, it could also be more granular.</p>&#xA;"

I have build a class that will fetch and store all constants in class variable, so it's available from every part of the the app. The good thing about this solution is performance (thanks to memoization it's only one api request) and it's easy to use later. The bad thing is I have no idea how to handle tests in this case. Of course I cannot let my tests make request to main app and stubbing this request makes the whole idea pointless, because after every change of constants in main app I will need to change tests in admin app. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Second approach I thought of is building a gem that will store all constants. It's very easy to implement, but this means I will need to make changes to this repo every time I want to change constants in main app. Also I work with big team and they won't be happy that they have to work on 2 repos at the same time.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What do you think about those solutions?

So far we think this should be the structure of the JSON from Client Service to Notification Service (step #1):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{&#xA;    template_id: SOME_TEMPLATE_ID,&#xA;    user_id: SOME_USER_ID,&#xA;    objectid: SOME_OBJECT_ID&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>or</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{&#xA;    template_id: SOME_TEMPLATE_ID,&#xA;    user_id: SOME_USER_ID,&#xA;    required_objects: { task_id: SOME_TASK_ID, document_id: SOME_DOCUMENT_ID }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where task_id and document_id are just examples and it would change based on the template. It could just as easily be <code>{product_id: SOME_PRODUCT_ID}</code> for a different template.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Why The Debate</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our thoughts so far are that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>We only need template_id because the source of the data would be implied in the objects (like an ENV var). For example, the Task object would be at <a href=""http://taskservice/:id"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://taskservice/:id</a>. Otherwise, we can have problems with failing APIs or switching URLs in the future.</li>&#xA;<li>We should use userid instead of email and name because we prevent the issue of email/ name pairs not matching up over multiple messages</li>&#xA;<li>For the objects, we're still sceptical because it means that the client app service would need knowledge of the inner workings in Messagebot but a single objectid might not be very extensible. We could easily imagine many of our messages needing more than one object.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you for reading. The design of this service is important because it will be central to our entire organisation. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which debated JSON structure is most appropriate in our situation?

The second, in theory, if a target server is down for some time, the client could eventually reach OOM attempting retry because threads are ultimately limited, even Quasar Fibers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know it's a little paranoid, but I'm wondering if a queue-based alternative would be more advantageous at very large scale.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It would still work asynchronously like Quasar/fibers, except a) the queue is centrally managed and off the client JVM, and b) the queue can be durable, so that in the event client and or target servers go down, no in flight messages are lost.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The downside to queue of course is that there are more hops and it slows down the system.

These 3 different services generally runs on 3 different data centers locations, so i.e different instances for each service. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem trying to solve:&#xA;I need to send updates(its kind of polling, checking if there are any updated records) in service A, then send updated information to services B and C, through REST call. Based on these updates service B and C does it's own processing. Once after deployment(mostly into cloud). How does A knows which B, C instances are up and running. SO that it can send updates to running instances.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Do we need to keep track of running instances into some DB table and lookup for active instances before sending updates from A?. (OR) just create some indicator or sequence number based approach to find out there are some updates at A, So we need to send out.But in this does it A knows what all are active instances running? Or else, we just need to send updates from A, so that some router or load balancer or some other thing will takes care of sending to available active instances running regardless of storing and looking up for active instances</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am not much familiar with network and prod systems behavior and its communication in cloud systems.</p>&#xA;"

Does the author mean the <em>service boundaries themselves</em> are poorly designed if a need for a shared library emerges, or does he really mean I should duplicate the code in the case of common business logic dependency? I don't see what that solves.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let's say I have a shared library of entities common to two services. The common domain objects for two services may smell, but another service is the GUI to tweak the state of those entities, another is an interface for other services to poll the state for their purpose. Same domain, different function.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, if the shared knowledge changes, I would have to rebuild and deploy both services regardless of the common code being an external dependency or duplicated across the services. Generally, same concerns all the cases for two services depending of the same article of the business logic. In this case, I see only harm of duplication of the code, reducing the cohesion of the system.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course, <em>diverging</em> from the shared knowledge may cause headaches in the case of shared library, but even this could be solved with inheritance, composition and clever use of abstractions.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, what does Sam mean by saying code duplication is better than too much coupling via shared libraries? </p>&#xA;"
48861926,How to keep state consistent across distributed systems,2018-02-19 08:17:01,<rest><web-services><architecture><microservices><distributed-computing>,1,53,5,0.0,2,"<p>When building distributed systems, it must be ensured the client and the server eventually ends up with consistent view of the data they are operating on, i.e they never get out of sync. Extra care is needed, because network can not be considered reliable. In other words, in the case of network failure, client never knows if the operation was successful, and may decide to retry the call.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Consider a microservice, which exposes simple CRUD API, and unbounded set of clients, maintained in-house by the same team, by different teams and by different companies also.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the example, client request a creation of new entity, which the microservice successfully creates and persists, but the network fails and client connection times out. The client will most probably retry, unknowingly persisting the same entity second time. Here is one possible solution to this I came up with:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Use client-generated identifier to prevent duplicate post</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This could mean the primary key as it is, the half of the client and server -generated composite key, or the token issued by the service. A service would either persist the entity, or reply with OK message in the case the entity with that identifier is already present.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But there is more to this: What if the client gives up after network failure (but entity got persisted), mutates it's internal view of the entity, and later decides to persist it in the service with the same id. At this point and generally, would it be reasonable for the service just silently:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><em>Update</em> the existing entity with the state that client posted</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or should the service answer with some more specific status code about what happened? The point is, developer of the service couldn't really influence the client design solutions.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, what are some sensible practices to keep the state consistent across distributed systems and avoid most common pitfalls in the case of network and system failure?</p>&#xA;"

Through my research of microservices I understand that the lines of demarcation between services should mirror the separations of concerns between them. An additional factor affecting separation is which services are required to scale individually.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As a concrete example, depending on the level of granularity desired, a microservice environment could end up like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Accounts (containing Signup, Login, Profiles, etc.)</li>&#xA;<li>Store (containing Products, Payments, Reporting, Inventories, etc.)</li>&#xA;<li>Chat/Social (containing chat rooms, user statuses, etc.)</li>&#xA;<li>...</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or it could end up with each of the areas of concern in brackets represented by their own microservice, e.g:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Accounts</li>&#xA;<li>Signup</li>&#xA;<li>Login</li>&#xA;<li>...</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I believe there is a preference in the microservices community for the second approach, and I tend to agree. However, the issue I have is one of hosting and resource limitations.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the migration I would like to streamline the provisioning of resources and the installation of updated services. Since we use the AWS stack, Elastic Beanstalk seemed like the perfect choice. While researching Elastic Beanstalk though I was rather disheartened to discover that there was a limit of 25 applications per account. Not only that, but EC2 has a limit of 20 instances per region per account. It seems like a microservice architecture will hit that limit very quickly, especially when you add multiple environments (staging and production) for each service into the mix, let alone websites and internal tooling.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With all of the amazing content that I've seen around the web regarding microservices, I'm surprised and somewhat disappointed at the lack of information regarding the actual hosting of microservices beyond the development of them. Have I missed something? Is there any information about deploying more than a couple of microservices on AWS?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It is my understanding that Netflix use AWS for their own microservice hosting, beyond requesting additional resources from Amazon and throwing money at it, are there other solutions? Would their Asgard tool help with this issue (possibly by handling the sharing of instances between services) or would it result in the same outcome?</p>&#xA;"

No need for ever accessing a users calendar, email etc. so I really just need the authentication part and nothing else (proof of successful login). All user access is defined in my own database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So a few fundamental questions comes to mind.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>First of all, is OpenID Connect even the right tool for the job for authentication only (I'll have no use for authorization, since I will not need read/write access to google / facebook API's other than getting the ID from authenticating)?</li>&#xA;<li>People generally do not agree on whether to use the ID or Access token for accessing your own API's. As far as I understand the ID token is for the client (user-agent) only, and the access token is for eg. accessing google calendar, emails etc.... External API's of the OpenID Provider... but since I'll only be accessing my own API's, do I event need the access token or the ID token - what is the correct way to protect your own API's?</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If the ID token is really just for the client, so it can show eg. currently logged in user, without going to the DB, I have 0 use for it, since I'll probably query the user from from the db and store it in redux for my react frontend app.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Dilemma: To store user details, groups, roles and permission inside JWT or not for API authorization?</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>By only storing the user identifier in the token, it means that I always allow authenticated users that has a valid token, to call endpoints BEFORE authorization and first then determine access based on the db query result and the permissions in my own database.</li>&#xA;<li>By storing more data about the user inside the JWT, it means that in some cases, I'd be able to do the authorization / access (group, role, permission) check before hitting the API - only possible with user info, groups, roles and permission stored inside a JWT issued upon login. In some cases it would not be possible due to eg. the CMS content access permissions being on a per-node level. But still it would mean a little better performance. </li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can see on the diagram I'm sending all API requests through the gateway, which will (in itself or with an authentication service) translate the opaque access token into some JWT with an identifier, so I can identify the user in the graph database - and then verify if the user has the required groups, roles and permissions - not from an external API, but from my own database like you see on the diagram.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This seems like a lot of work on every request, even if the services can share the JWT in case multiple services should need to cross call each other.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The advantage of always looking up the user, and his permissions in the db, is naturally that the moment the user access levels change, he is denied/granted access immediately and it will always be in sync. If I store the user details, groups, roles and permission inside a JWT and persist that in the client localstorage, I guess it could pose a security issue right, and it would be pretty hard to update the user info, groups, roles and permissions inside that JWT?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One big advantage of storing user access levels and info inside the JWT is of course that in many cases I'd be able to block the user from calling certain API's, instead of having to determine access after a db lookup.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the whole token translation thing means increased security at the cost of performance, but is is generally recommended and worth it? Or is it safe enough to store user info and groups, roles, permissions inside the JWT? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If yes, do I store all that information from my own DB in the ID Token, Access token or a 3rd token - what token is sent to the API and determines if the user should be granted access to a given resource based on his permissions in the db? Do I really need an access token if I don't need to interact with the ID providers API? Or do I store and append all my groups, roles, permissions inside the ID token (that doesn't seem clean to me) issued by OpenID connect, and call the API and authorize my own API endpoints using that, even if some say you should never use the ID token to access an API? Or do I create a new JWT to store all the info fetched from my database, which is to be used for deciding if the user can access a given resource / API endpoint?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please do not just link to general specs or general info, since I've already read it all - I just failed to understand how to apply all that info to my actual use case (the diagram above). Try to please be as concrete as possible.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Made another attempt to try and simply the flow:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1d1Tn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1d1Tn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>&#xA;"

A single running instance of the application is used by multiple tenants to access their data.

Now, I have to scale the application up. To do so, I increase the number of running instances, and the load balancer routes each request to one of the instances. By doing so, each instance keeps a connection pool for each tenant's database, since it can serve requests from any tenant. The result is something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uyosV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uyosV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem is that it grows up exponentially as the number of tenants increases -- higher number of tenants demands more running instances, both of them demands a higher number of connections which demands an increasing number of resources just to keep track of the connection pool.

I've right now a monolithic application and my goal is to split the application in small microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My bigest problem is for authentication (for now). After reading a LOT a documentation, It seems that the best solution is to use OpenID Connect to authenticate an user to retrieve a JWT that can by passed with the request to the microservices. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, to avoid having multiple endpoints, you can deploy and API Gateway to have only one endpoint for the end user. Ok, so now I've two questions with this architecture.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The standard flow for authentication will be :</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>An user contact my identity server in OpenID Connect with the implicit flow and get the id_token (JWT) and also the access_token. The user can now contact my API with this access_token. The API Gateway will valide the access_token with the identity server and also retrieve the JWT to add it to the sub request to the microservice API. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1/ How the API Gateway can get the JWT from the access_token? From what I red from the documentation (<a href=""http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html</a>), It can contact the ""/userinfo"" endpoint but It will get just the JSON format not the JWT...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2/ I want to allow authenticated calls between my microservices. So each microservice needs to be able to generate a JWT to contact other microservices directly. My first thought was to contact the identity server. But with the OAuth2 Client Credentials flow, I don't retrieve a id_token or a JWT. Just a classic OAuth2 access token without JWT. My second thought was that the microservice can directly sign its own JWT with a certificate issued by the same PKI as the one used by the identity server. That mean that a JWT can be sign by several certificats but from the same private PKI. When a microservice receives a JWT, It needs to be able to identify witch certificat was used to sign the JWT. I don't find anything on the RFC regarding this problem. I can add my own private claim in the token to have the certificate but after several days of browsing the web without seeing this kind of solution, I'm wondering if I'm not on the wrong path... To sum up, how can i perfom ""User to service"" authentication AND alors ""service to service"" authentication in JWT?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you very much!</p>&#xA;"

Is it the only difference between them?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's the quoted text:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>""multiple copies of the same microservice can be deployed in order to&#xA;  achieve a form of scalability. However, most companies that adopt&#xA;  microservices too early will use the same storage subsystem (most&#xA;  often a database) to back all of their microservices. What that means&#xA;  is that you don’t really have horizontal scalability for your&#xA;  application, only for your service.

I'm going to use this approach but want to know the best way to go about it using Couchbase Sync Gateway since I want to use Sync Gateway REST API calls both from mobile AND backend server apps. I am thinking that the simplest way to go about this is to have one Couchbase cluster (3-n Couchbase Server instances) with maybe 2-3 buckets. A bucket for sessions maybe, another for all of my data, and maybe some others later. For each microservice's ""database"", instead of having different physical clusters for each, I'm thinking I should just put all of the data in one bucket and differentiate the databases and tables by document fields. So maybe I would have something like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{&#xA;  database: 'person-api'&#xA;  doc_type: 'Person'&#xA;&#xA;  ...&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would also have multiple database entries for each service all pointing to the same bucket in my sync-gateway config file. Then I would need to set up ACLs or some kind of controls that would only allow the backend server applications to access their own databases (so the 'election-api' server could only read/write docs with the corresponding <code>database</code> property). This would all have to be through Sync Gateway, for writes at least (I might do most reads using the sdks instead). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sync Gateway is still a bit confusing to me and I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Would I just use channels as a sort of ACL? Is this just a bad approach to begin with? Any suggestions? thanks!</p>&#xA;"

Authentication is done via OAuth2 token provision, using JDBC Token Store. Logging in, obtaining the token works well, requesting data from either of the other two resource servers works well too. However I am not happy with how I'm doing it, as it seems a bit clunky:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>All of the data on resource servers is linked to the user via server-side generated user ID. I believe linking it to the username is a bad idea should the user ever want to change his/her username. Right now, the way I'm getting the user ID is in short:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)&#xA;public ResponseEntity&lt;SampleData&gt; getData(OAuth2Authentication authentication) {&#xA;    Authentication auth = authentication.getUserAuthentication();&#xA;    final Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = (Map) auth.getDetails();&#xA;&#xA;    // parse user data from the map ...&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The method <code>getDetails</code> returns the whole User object on the Auth server as a map - because that's the way I linked it in <strong>application.properties</strong> file:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>security.oauth2.resource.userInfoUri=http://localhost:9000/api-auth/user&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I can't bring myself to be OK with this solution, because:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>All user-facing methods would have to start with this parsing and even after I made it into a separate class, it's still the same two lines for every method.</li>&#xA;<li>I feel like the methods shouldn't even have the object <code>OAuth2Authentication authentication</code> as the input - it should be in a layer above and not here (could be my wrong feeling, though).</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is - can I do it more efficiently? In a more clean and sustainable way?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'd like to have:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)&#xA;public ResponseEntity&lt;SampleData&gt; getData(String userId) {&#xA;    // interact with data with the userId&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And definitely <strong>not</strong> depend on the client sending this data - this has to come from the Auth server.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My (so far failed) thoughts:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>JWT token usage - failed on the fact that I'm using JDBC Token Store and that seems to be not compatible with JWT. Also JWT tokens cannot be revoked as they're not stored and have to be dealt with through short-lived access/refresh tokens. But if nothing else works, I am open to this approach.</li>&#xA;<li>Filters - my favorite, I thought this would be it, but I couldn't make it work - I receive the request in a e.g. <code>OncePerRequestFilter</code> and parse the data. But then I was unable to distribute the parsed object straight into the controller. This seemed like the solution, but I guess it's not meant for this, perhaps.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I approaching this completely wrong or am I missing some Spring Boot detail that solves this automatically?</p>&#xA;"

43212533,Eventual Consistency in microservice-based architecture temporarily limits functionality,2017-04-04 16:15:01,<microservices><application-design><eventual-consistency><event-based-programming>,1,629,3,0.0,2,"<p>I'll illustrate my question with Twitter. For example, Twitter has microservice-based architecture which means that different processes are in different servers and have different databases.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A new tweet appears, server A stored in its own database some data, generated new events and fired them. Server B and C didn't get these events at this point and didn't store anything in their databases nor processed anything.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The user that created the tweet wants to edit that tweet. To achieve that, all three services A, B, C should have processed all events and stored to db all required data, but service B and C aren't consistent yet. <strong>That means that we are not able to provide edit functionality</strong> at the moment.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As I can see, a possible workaround could be in switching to immediate consistency, but that will take away all microservice-based architecture benefits and probably could cause problems with tight coupling.    </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another workaround is to restrict user's actions for some time till data aren't consistent across all necessary services. Probably a solution, depends on customer and his business requirements.    </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And another workaround is to add additional logic or probably service D that will store edits as user's actions and apply them to data only when they will be consistent. Drawback is very increased complexity of the system.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And there are two-phase commits, but that's 1) not really reliable 2) slow.<br>&#xA;I think slowness is a huge drawback in case of such loads as Twitter has. But probably it could be solved, whereas lack of reliability cannot, again, without increased complexity of a solution.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, the questions are: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Are there any nice solutions to the illustrated situation or only things that I mentioned as workarounds? Maybe some programming platforms or databases?</li>&#xA;<li>Do I misunderstood something and some of workarounds aren't correct?</li>&#xA;<li>Is there any other approach except Eventual Consistency that will guarantee that all data will be stored and all necessary actions will be executed by other services?</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Why Eventual Consistency has been picked for this use case</em>? As I can see, right now it is the only way to guarantee that some data will be stored or some action will be performed if we are talking about event-driven approach when some of services will start their work when some event is fired, and following my example, that event would be “tweet is created”. So, in case if services B and C go down, I need to be able to perform action successfully when they will be up again.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Things I would like to achieve are: reliability, ability to bear high loads, adequate complexity of solution. Any links on any related subjects will be very much appreciated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If there are natural limitations of this approach and what I want cannot be achieved using this paradigm, it is okay too. I just need to know that this problem really isn't solved yet.</p>&#xA;"

I'm guessing the answer is yes. So, I guess my real question is, isn't this consuming a lot more hardware resources than a monolithic application with a single database? Databases are pretty memory hungry...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Not only that but the full amount of ram required for running a single spring-boot application will be required 5 times over if I'm running 5 microservices right? It seems to me this would require far, far more ram than the monolithic application, correct?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What about if you are using Oracle as a database? What implications does it have for licencing? Wouldn't it get crazy expensive if you need a separate database for each microservice?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Are there any other licencing pitfalls to consider? Or any other pitfalls of MSA in general that one should consider/be aware of before starting out on this journey?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Edit:&#xA;Also, given each microservice is full-stack, what if I want a consist looking front-end for each of them (where a microservice requires a front-end)? I haven't seen any good advice around this. Especially given (if they are so called '12 factor') the codebase is supposed to be in separate repository for each microservice.

Unfortunately, the event log resides within another database so I have to think about a distributed transaction.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Most CQRS samples deal with the saga pattern and they all seem to utilize event sourcing, which makes things much simpler.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My problem is a ""half-finished"" state change, e.g.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>SQL Insert succeeds</li>&#xA;<li>Event Log Insert fails</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I could come up with a compensating SQL operation (pseudo code):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>SQLTransaction.Commit(); // if this fails, all is fine.

The micro service offers a REST API to a user interface, and there will be several other micro services. Those other micro services are supposed to listen to an event stream (event sourcing) generated by the UI-connected service to keep additional read models in sync.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am trying to figure out a way to guarantee that the events published to the change event stream exactly match the changes to the data in the underlying data store.  Generally, the concern is that if the REST API handler e.g. is interrupted half-way through its execution, it may have changed the data but not created the event yet (assuming that the change event is published after the data change). I am now looking for mechanisms that will alleviate this concern. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For DynamoDB there are DynamoDB streams and AWS Lambda Triggers to react to data changes at data store level. The triggered Lambda could transformation the low-level data change into a meaningful change event and then publish the event to SNS, SQS or Kinesis.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For Aurora MySQL I have yet to come up with such a mechanism. I have seen articles that describe two mechanisms:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Enable the binary log for Aurora and use an additional EC2 instance to process the change stream. Publish events for other services from this stream.</li>&#xA;<li>Use the native lambda_sync or lambda_async function to call a Lambda from MySQL triggers. Publish events for other services from within this Lambda.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One, I am not too happy with either approach: 1) I would prefer not to manage additional EC2 instances and process raw SQL changes. 2) I am planning to use constraints, optimistic concurrency and transactions for Aurora, which means that transactions can and will fail and rollback. However, the lambda_(a)sync calls will have been executed regardless of the transaction outcome.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any better ideas for Aurora? Or am I looking at this problem from the wrong angle?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would like to keep this question and discussion focused to the question of how to guarantee consistency between changes an the underlying data store and an outgoing stream with change events, not on Aurora vs. DynamoDB.</p>&#xA;"

All your model, i.e. your core system which handles all requests made etc. are in one file. But this contains different function definitions within this file for each different kind of request.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One of the disadvantages of Monolithic architecture is that one faulty functionality will bring the entire system down. If one of these functions stopped working as expected, how will it bring the entire system down? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If it does then how would this problem be solved in a Microservices architecture? The Microservice conversion would mean splitting the single file into multiple files each doing one specific thing. The requests are made to these many different model files. Since the dependencies between that specific service and others would still be there, would it not bring the system down in Microservices architecture as well?</p>&#xA;"

I think I understand it on a basic level at this point, but if it works like I believe I'm being told...I just can't tell if it's a good fit.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We have a microservices platform which is essentially a large data bus between our customers. They use a set of APIs to push and pull shared data. The filtering, thus far, is pretty simple...but there's no way to know what the future may bring.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>On top of this platform is an analytics layer with several visualizations (bar charts, graphs, etc.) based on the data being passed around.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The microservices platform was built atop MySQL with the idea that we could use clustering, which we honestly did not have a lot of luck with. On top of that, changes are painful, as is par for the course in the RDBMS world. Also, we expect extraordinary amounts of data with thousands-upon-thousands of concurrent users - it seems that we'll have an inevitable scaling problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, we began looking at Cassandra as a distributed nosql potential replacement.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I watched the DataStax videos, took a course on another site, and started digging in. What I'm finding is:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Data is stored redundantly across several tables, each of which uses different primary and clustering keys, to enable different types of queries, since rows are scattered across different nodes in the cluster</li>&#xA;<li>Rather than joining, which isn't supported, you'd denormalize and create ""wide"" tables with tons of columns</li>&#xA;<li>Data is eventually consistent, so new writes may not be readily readable in a predictable, reasonable amount of time.</li>&#xA;<li>CQL, while SQL-like, is mostly a lie. How you store and key data determines which types of queries you can use. It seems very limited and inflexible.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>While these concepts make sense to me, I'm struggling to see how this would fit most long-term database needs. If data is redundant across several different tables...how is it managed and kept consistent across those many tables? Are materialized views the answer in this case?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I <em>want</em> to like this idea and love the distributed features, but frankly am mostly scared off, at this point. I feel like I've learned a lot and nothing at all, in the last week, and am entirely unsure how to proceed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I looked into JanusGraph, Elassandra, etc. to see if that would provide a simpler interface on top of Cassandra, relegating it to basically a storage engine, but am not confident many of these things are mature enough or even proper, for what we need.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I suppose I'm looking for direction and insight from those of you who have built things w/ Cassandra, to see if it's a fit for what we're doing. I'm out of R&amp;D time, unfortunately. Thanks!</p>&#xA;"

Now there is an auth token container, which I need to call to get the access token. That auth token library has a class like this. Notice that the class <code>AuthServletContextListener</code> comes from a third party  <code>jar</code> file which I can not modify.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>public class AuthServletContextListener implements ServletContextListener {&#xA;    public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent arg0) {&#xA;        try {&#xA;            ServletContext e = arg0.getServletContext();&#xA;            Properties config = new Properties();&#xA;            this.addProp(config, e, ""auth.token.url"", ""Token Service URL"");&#xA;            this.addProp(config, e, ""auth.system.username"", ""System Username"");&#xA;            this.addProp(config, e, ""cauth.system.password"", ""System Password"");&#xA;            TokenContainer.init(config);&#xA;        } catch (IOException arg3) {&#xA;            arg3.printStackTrace();&#xA;        }&#xA;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    private void addProp(Properties config, ServletContext context, String propName, String descrip) {&#xA;        String propVal = (String) context.getAttribute(propName);&#xA;        if (StringUtils.isEmpty(propVal)) {&#xA;            propVal = context.getInitParameter(propName);&#xA;        }&#xA;&#xA;        if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(propVal)) {&#xA;            config.put(propName, propVal);&#xA;        } else {&#xA;            throw new RuntimeException(""error: "");&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The AuthContextListener has an annotation that automatically looks for an application startup event. This automatically starts the container correct settings if the above context params are included. I can then grab the token through that container like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>TokenContainer.getSystemToken() &#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This will initialize successfully if the above context params are included in the web.xml like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;context-param&gt;&#xA;   &lt;param-name&gt;auth.system.username&lt;/param-name&gt;&#xA;   &lt;param-value&gt;UserName&lt;/param-value&gt;&#xA;&lt;/context-param&gt; &#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The same Application context configuration as above can be performed by creating a Spring bean with the following information:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;bean&gt;&#xA;    &lt;property name=""attributes""&gt;&#xA;        &lt;map&gt;&#xA;            &lt;entry key=""auth.token.url"" value=""${auth.token.url}""/&gt;&#xA;            &lt;entry key=""auth.system.username"" value=""${auth.system.username}""/&gt;&#xA;            &lt;entry key=""auth.system.password"" value=""${auth.system.password}""/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/map&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/property&gt;&#xA;&lt;/bean&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is how can I achieve the same using Java based configuration in a latest spring boot application. All I have is <code>application.yml</code> file with the auth endpoint, username and password values. I tried using <code>@Configuration</code> bean but no luck. How can I set those three props in application context and make that listener start automatically for me.</p>&#xA;"

Now that the core domain is pretty much done (i use a DDD approach) and i implemented most of the CRUD Repositories, i want to make this a bit more extensible by hosting the core functionality online, so i am able to write multiple backends (desktop application, web application, web api, etc).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Service Oriented Architecture (or Microservices) sound like a good approach to me to do that.

That way my clients could consume the web interface. The Desktop and Web apps would be different projects on their own.

40660163,Microservices dependence management - Governance or Domain Driven Design?,2016-11-17 16:30:33,<domain-driven-design><dependency-management><microservices><soa-governance>,1,318,1,0.0,2,"<p><strong>Background</strong>: an international company with a federation model is transforming into Microservices due to chronic Monolithic pain. Autonomous teams with quick deployment is highly desirable. In spite of theory, services are indeed dependent on each other for higher functionality, but are autonomous (independently developed and deployed). Since this is a federation model and decentralized control, we cannot impose strict rules - just like the UN. Without a governance platform that will manage dependencies else due to the multiple versions in production in different countries, we foresee uncontrollable chaos.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let's call set of Microservices that needs to collaborate a ""Compatibility Set"". A service can be deployed but may not satisfy the higher functionality in its Compatibility Set.  For example MicroService A-4.3 is fully autonomous, deployed and working perfectly. However to satisfy BusinessFunctionality 8.6 it must work together with MicroService B-5.4 and MicroService C-2.9. Together (A-4.3 , B-5.4 and C-2.9) they form a ""Compatibility Set""</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are two approaches to this dilemma. Microservice in real life where the rubber hits the road and the learning from experience begins...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Approach 1) Governance Platform</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Rationale</em>: Federal model in an International company in 100+ countries. Which means Central IT can lay down the model but individual countries can choose their own destiny - and they frequently do. It frequently devolves to chaos and the Central IT team is on the hook. DDD is the solution for an ideal world where version inconsistencies do not derail functionality like releasing services which do not fit into the Compatibility set, individually blameless but together they fall apart or result in flawed or inconsistent functionality.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>There is no homogeneity, there isn't even standardization of terminology</li>&#xA;<li>Developers are mixed skill, many junior, and many learning reactive programming and cloud native technologies</li>&#xA;<li>Bounded Context heavily depends on Shared Vocabulary and it can get subtle, but this is impossible to enforce and naive to assume in an International, mixed skill, fragmented scenario with multiple versions running</li>&#xA;<li>Standardization on a Single Business Model is not realistic in such a heterogeneous system (but ideal)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How what is Central IT to do when they're held responsible for this Chaos?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Enforce a Governance Platform</em>&#xA;Create a Microservices governance system or framework to enforce dependency management. It verifies and enforces at design and run time dependencies on a particular Microservice through a manifest and performs some checks and balances to verify the service implementations being offered - the  ""Compatibility Set"". </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Approach 2)  Domain Driven Design (DDD)</strong>&#xA;DDD is about modelling domains that are constantly evolving, where domain experts (typically a business stakeholder, or perhaps an analyst) will work alongside developers to design the system. Within each domain, a ubiquitous language is formed, such that within that context, the same word always means the same thing. An important thing to realise is that in one part of your system, “Order” might mean one thing, it might mean for example a list of products. In another part of your system, “Order” might mean something else, it might mean a financial transaction that happened. This is where the model you describe can fall down, if my service needs to get a list of orders, perhaps there is a capability out there that supplies a list of orders, but which orders are they? The list of products or the financial transaction? Trying to coordinate as many developers as you have to all use the same language here is an impossible task that is doomed to fail.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In DDD, rather than trying to manage this at a system level and force every service to use the same definition of Order, DDD embraces the inherent complexity in coordinating very large deployments with huge numbers of developers involved, and allows each team to work independently, coordinating with other teams as needed, not through some centralised dependency management system. The term used in DDD is bounded contexts, where in one context, Order means one thing, and in another bounded context, Order can mean another thing. These contexts can function truly autonomously – you describe your services as being autonomous, but if they have to match their definition of order with the entire system by registering and supplied dependencies to a central registry, then really they are tightly coupled to the rest of the system and what it considers an order to be – you end up with all the painful coupling of a monolith, with all the pain of building a distributed system, and you won’t realise many of the benefits of microservices if you try to take this approach.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So a DDD based approach doesn’t ever try to take a heavy handed approach of enforcing dependencies or capabilities at the system level, rather, it allows individual teams to work without needing central coordination, if Service A needs to interact with Service B, then the team who manages Service A will work with the team that manages service B, they can build an interface between their bounded contexts, and come to an agreement on language for that interface. It is up to these teams to manage their dependencies with each other, at the system level things can remain quite opaque / unenforced.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Too often we see people implement “Microservices” but end up with a system that is just as, if not more inflexible, and often more fragile, than a monolith. Also called a ""Minilith"" or ""Monolith 2.0"" Microservices require a complete rethink of architecture and software development processes, and require not just allowing services to be autonomous and independently managed, but also for teams to be independent, not centrally managed. Centralising the management of dependencies and capabilities in a system is likely to be an inhibitor to successfully building a microservice based system.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Intelligent and Pragmatic comments invited...</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Approach 1 (Governance) is pragmatic and tactical and intended to solve very real challenges. Question is - will it undermine the long term strategic DDD model of the Enterprise?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Approach 2 (DDD) is ideal and aspirational but doesn't address the very real challenges that we have to deal with right now. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Opinions? Thought? Comments? </p>&#xA;"

43538070,How to manage state in microservices?,2017-04-21 08:49:10,<kubernetes><microservices>,1,464,4,0.0,2,"<p>First of all, this is a question regarding my thesis for school. I have done some research about this, it seems like a problem that hasn't been tackled yet (might not be that common).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Before jumping right into the problem, I'll give a brief example of my use case.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have multiple namespaces containing microservices depending on a state X. To manage this the microservices are put in a namespace named after the state. (so namespaces state_A, state_B, ...)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Important to know is that each microservice needs this state at startup of the service. It will download necessary files, ... according to the state. When launching it with state A version 1, it is very likely that the state gets updated every month. When this happens, it is important to let all the microservices that depend on state A upgrade whatever necessary (databases, in-memory state, ...).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My current approach for this problem is simply using events, the microservices that need updates when the state changes can subscribe on the event and migrate/upgrade accordingly. The only problem I'm facing is that while the service is upgrading, it should still work. So somehow I should duplicate the service first, let the duplicate upgrade and when the upgrade is successful, shut down the original. Because of this the used orchestration service would have to be able to create duplicates (including duplicating the state).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is, are there already solutions for my problem (and if yes, which ones)? I have looked into Netflix Conductor (which seemed promising with its workflows and events), Amazon SWF, Marathon and Kubernetes, but none of them covers my problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Best of all the existing solution should not be bound to a specific platform (Azure, GCE, ...).</p>&#xA;"

In <code>RoleServiceProject</code> we create Rest Controller for rest API of Role Operations. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As microservices architecture says each service should be independently deployable.

I found a few solutions on the internet but all of them have some drawbacks and none of them is a good fit for us.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let me clearify my problem. We have over 5 groups of people working on different microservices in a large single project. And almost all of them has some common,shared components on frontend. And these components are huge as they are already a different project but totally shared. Now how to manage these shared components or should we duplicate them?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>First solution I found is to make those components shared and maintain from a single point like node packages and npm install when needed from different groups. But at this point the microservice approach is broken since everybody will be dependent to these components and no one will be able to maintain as soon as they need, not good. And very hard to maintain since in the future different groups may different needs from the component.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Second is to duplicate the components according to each project and develop within the microservice group but this time it becomes very frankenstein and the common concepts that we should obey are hard to catch. It's a really enterprise project that all components should match in terms of behaivor and look to the other components reoccured in the project. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So we need a frontend solution for microservices that should be suitable for an enterprise project which is needed to obey same rules(like font size,color,actions etc..) at different points as it is monolithly written, but maintainable by different groups at the same time.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can we balance that or can we?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks to @kayess: Shortly how to apply shared kernel on microservices as the teams will not be dependent to each other?</p>&#xA;"

27857790,Best practice for redirecting between docker containers,2015-01-09 09:47:35,<redirect><docker><reverse-proxy><boot2docker><microservices>,1,964,4,0.0,3,"<p>Given I have multiple web applications running in docker containers, I want to be able to let the user be redirected from on service to another service in his browser. I wonder how to achieve this - especially if I want my applications to be portable from one docker host to a different host. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let's say we have a ServiceA which redirects the user to ServiceB. So we have a relationship </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><code>ServiceA --&gt; ServiceB</code></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One approach would be to statically assign ports and hostnames and set them as environment vars to my web services - which I would not prefer because I don't want to care about which service runs on which port.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A second approach would be to have a proxy like nginx and link the services and use the proxy host and port. But this would require to change the proxy configuration when moving a service to a different host.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The third approach that comes to mind, is to use etcd and ambassadors to register and resolve services. So ServiceA would use a ServiceB-Ambassador which looks up ServiceB in etcd. This results in many docker containers just to connect between services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which way would you prefer? Or are there different approaches?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The real problem is to inject the uri of ServiceB into ServiceA, so I can launch my ServiceA with an argument like <code>-DserviceB.uri=&lt;serviceUri&gt;</code>, so that serviceA can build the correct redirect header.</p>&#xA;"

But what about if I want to access the Stuff service that needs you to be already connected?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let say that the user wants to display the stuff available in the database STUFF, the service Stuff will first check if the ""token"" of the connected user is right, by exchanging with the Authentication service, and then return the stuff or a ""login requires request"".</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the thing I don't understand is, if each services that needs a client already connected needs to exchange with Authentication, then it will create a huge internet traffic in order to check each user request.. So I though about make one Authentication service per service, but since I should have only one Database, then it's the database that will slow the traffic?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, if I understand, each micro service should be on separate servers, not the same one?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I hope I am clear, don't hesitate to ask for more details !</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Max</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h1>Edit 1</h1>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Based on @notionquest's answer:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So it should more looks like that right?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdOdR.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdOdR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, based on Peter's comment, each service can implement its own middleware (JWT as mentioned) so the API Gateway is only a ""pass-through"". However, I don't feel like it could be a nice for me since each service make a token check for each internal exchange, doesn't it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the stuff, it's easy since it checks only 1 time the token. Now, let's say that, after the user got the stuff, he choose one and wanna buy it. Then the ""Buying service"" will call the stuff service in order the verify the price of the item, but... It will have to check the user token since the stuff is a ""on authenticated access"", so it means that ""Buying"" service and ""Stuff"" service both check the token, which add an extra check.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I though about an internal guaranteed access between services but is it worth it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, maybe you said to implement the middleware for each service since they have a REST access, but the API Gateway would just destroy the idea of having REST access</p>&#xA;"

Despite the project of consisting ten of thousands of classes and dozens of EJB's, most of the business logic resides in relational database views and triggers for a reason: A lot of joins, unions and constraints involved in all business transactions. In other words, there is complex web of dependencies and constraints between the bounded contexts, which restricts the state transfers. In layman terms: the business rules are very complicated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, if I were to split this monolith to database per service microservices architecture, bounded contexts being the suggested service boundaries, I will have to implement all the business logic with explicit API calls. I would end up with hundreds of API's implementing all these stupid little business rules. As the performance is main factor (we use a lot of effort to optimize the SQL as it is now), this is out of the question. Secondly, segregated API's would probably be nightmare to maintain in this web of ever evolving business rules, where as database triggers actually support the high cohesion and DRY mentality, enforcing the business rules transparently.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I came up with a conclusion microservice architecture being unsuitable for this type of document management system.

This network call first reaches the <code>user service</code> in the backend.  If the user was successful, it sends off an event saying a new user was created.

What I am missing - or maybe what I did not yet understand is, how to solve the issue of security and user authentication?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example: I develop a microservice which provides a Rest Service interface to a workflow engine. The engine is based on JEE and runs on application servers like GlassFish or Wildfly. &#xA;One of the core concepts of the workflow engine is, that each call is user centric. This means depending of the role and access level of the current user, the workflow engine produces individual results (e.g. a user-centric tasklist or processing an open task which depends on the users role in the process).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my eyes, thus a service is not accessible from everywhere. For example if someone plans to implement a modern Ajax based JavaScript application which should use the workflow microservice there are two problems:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1) to avoid the cross-scripting problem from JavaScript/Ajax the JavaScript Web application needs to be deployed under the same domain as the microservice runs</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) if the microservice forces a user authentication (which is the case in my scenario) the application need to provide a transparent authentication mechanism. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The situation becomes more complex if the client need to access more than one user-centric microservices forcing user authentication.&#xA;I always end up with an architecture where all services and the client application running on the same application server under the same domain.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can these problems be solved?

If you remove a customer on the customer service side, you end up with inconsistency. If your service has to notify the other services then you end up with tighlty coupled services which to me sounds like what you wanted to avoid in the first place. You could kind of avoid that by having an event mechanism which notify everyone but what about network errors when you don't even know who is supposed to receive the event?</li>&#xA;<li>I want to do a simple query : retrieve the customers from US that bought product A.

Moving image manipulation (crop, resize, etc.) into a microservice seemed the most sensible first step, since it drastically slows down my application now.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When the application is monolithic, there is no problem in passing certain files into file-manipulation logic — just read it from local storage disk. With microsevices, however, if we keep in mind <em>scalability</em>, it becomes more difficult. Of course, I could build an image manipulation microservice, scale it up <em>within the same host machine</em>, and share directories I need between it, so they, too, can read from a local disk.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What if I want a truly scalable microservice, that can be run and scaled on <em>different</em> machines with different IP-adresses that <em>don't share the same filesystem</em>? I thought that maybe I could take advantage of Node's streaming API and send these files back and forth via HTTP or TCP or sockets or you name it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As far as I've learned, Seneca.js cannot do it <em>the right way</em>. Of course, I could send a file from the main app to image manipulation service via Seneca.js like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>fs.createReadStream('/files/hello.jpg')&#xA;  .on('data', function(data) {&#xA;    seneca.act({ role: 'file', cmd: 'chunk', data: data }, cb);&#xA;  })&#xA;  .on('end', function(err) {&#xA;    seneca.act({ role: 'file', cmd: 'end' });&#xA;  })&#xA;  .on('error', function(err) {&#xA;    seneca.act({ role: 'test', cmd: 'error' });&#xA;  });&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And receive it in chunks:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>seneca.add({ role: 'file', cmd: 'chunk' }, writeToFileCb);&#xA;seneca.add({ role: 'file', cmd: 'end' }, endFileWriteCb);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But this approach seems ugly and wheel-reinventive.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another way would be to come up with some HTTP server and send files as <code>multipart/form-data</code> or <code>application/octet-stream</code>, like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>fs.createReadStream('file.json')&#xA;  .pipe(request.post('http://image-manipulator'))&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But this means reinventing the framework for microservice communication.

AMQP doesn't seem like a good fit for this, as the frontend service needs to wait for the response, and response times are critical. My first thought was to implement a REST interface for just this line of communication, but the same service also uses AMQP to subscribe to communication of other services. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This seems like it should be a pretty common occurrence, but I haven't been able to find any answers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I guess my main question is what to do when one service needs to offer both synchronous and asynchronous communication.

A few things I've considered:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Just using AMQP, sending a message with a <code>reply_to</code> field, and blocking until response is received.</li>&#xA;<li>Extract the data access part of the core backend service and giving it a REST API. Then both the web service and the part that ""subscribes"" would query this other service. Seems unnecessary to have a service just for access database.</li>&#xA;<li>Having multiple threads and using some kind of event loop to listen on two interfaces. Seems overly complex.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;"
29689630,Moving over to microservices for .NET apps - some questions,2015-04-17 03:18:48,<.net><rest><architecture><restsharp><microservices>,2,1406,0,2.0,3,"<p>I'd like to start getting into splitting my apps into microservices. My first task is to remove functionality that is repeated in each of our apps. Things like email sending, exporting, searching indexes etc - stuff where the same or similar code is repeated in every app.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I just feel a little overwhelmed and struggling to get a start. I understand that the purpose of microservices is that you can pick the right language for the job, but for our current purposes i'm going with the assumption that .NET would be the primary framework i'll be building everything in.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically, to start with, I want to create a microservice that simply sends emails that all our apps can talk to and tell to send the emails they need. The way I was thinking was the email sender has the logic to send the email, but each app needs to tell it the recipients, body etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm struggling with things like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>What protocol should the apps use to talk to this service? REST over HTTP? If this is the case, would the email sending microservice effectively just be a Web API 2 app (this is what I'd personally go with if i were to build a REST api).</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>If I'm going REST, whats the best way to make restful calls from the backend? Most emails in our system are sent via the backend code right now. I've seen the RestSharp name thrown around, is this generally considered the best way?</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Future planning, I think having some sort of gateway which knows about all the services would be beneficial so that each app only needs to know about this gateway and then the gateway talks to whatever services it needs. Would this just be yet another REST API in between the apps and the micro services?</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sorry for all the questions, just getting a start in all this sort of stuff (and architecture in general) in order to step up in my workplace and it's a bit to get my head around currently.</p>&#xA;"

44420585,Microservices: how to effectively deal with data dependencies between microservices,2017-06-07 18:47:49,<node.js><mean-stack><microservices>,2,125,0,1.0,3,"<p>I am developing an application utilizing the microservices development approach with the mean stack.  I am running into a situation where data needs to be shared between multiple microservices.  For example, let's say I have user, video, message(sending/receiving,inbox, etc.) services.  Now the video and message records belong to an account record.  As users create video and send /receive message there is a foreign key(userId) that has to be associated with the video and message records they create. I have scenarios where I need to display the first, middle and last name associated with each video for example.  Let's now say on the front end a user is scrolling through a list of videos uploaded to the system, 50 at a time.  In the worst case scenario, I could see a situation where a pull of 50 occurs where each video is tied to a unique user.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There seems to be two approaches to this issue:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One, I make an api call to the user service and get each user tied to each video in the list.  This seems inefficient as it could get really chatty if I am making one call per video.  In the second of the api call scenario, I would get the list of video and send a distinct list of user foreign keys to query to get each user tied to each video.  This seems more efficient but still seems like I am losing performance putting everything back together to send out for display or however it needs to be manipulated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Two, whenever a new user is created, the account service sends a message with the user information each other service needs to a fanout queue and then it is the responsibility of the individual services to add the new user to a table in it's own database thus maintaining loose coupling.  The extreme downside here would be the data duplication and having to have the fanout queue to handle when updates needs to be made to ensure eventual consistency.  Though, in the long run, this approach seems like it would be the most efficient from a performance perspective.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am torn between these two approaches, as they both have their share of tradeoffs.  Which approach makes the most sense to implement and why?</p>&#xA;"

36615117,microservice messaging db-assigned identifiers,2016-04-14 06:15:30,<microservices><spring-cloud-stream>,2,154,0,2.0,3,"<p>The company I work for is investigating moving from our current monolithic API to microservices. Our current API is heavily dependent on spring and we use SQL server for most persistence. Our microservice investigation is leaning toward spring-cloud, spring-cloud-stream, kafka, and polyglot persistence (isolated database per microservice). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a question about how messaging via kafka is typically done in a microservice architecture. We're planning to have a coordination layer between the set of microservices and our client applications, which will coordinate activities across different microservices and isolate clients from changes to microservice APIs. Most of the stuff we've read about using spring-cloud-stream and kafka indicate that we should use streams at the coordination layer (source) for resource change operations (inserts, updates, deletes), with the microservice being one consumer of the messages. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where I've been having trouble with this is inserts. We make heavy use of database-assigned identifiers (identity columns/auto-increment columns/sequences/surrogate keys), and they're usually assigned as part of a post request and returned to the caller. The coordination layer may be saving multiple things using different microservices and often needs the assigned identifier from one insert before it can move on to the next operation. Using messaging between the coordination layer and microservices for inserts makes it so the coordination layer can't get a response from the insert operation, so it can't get the assigned identifier that it needs. Additionally, other consumers on the stream (i.e. consumers that publish the data to a data warehouse) really need the message to contain the assigned identifier.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How are people dealing with this problem? Are database-assigned identifiers an anti-pattern in microservices? Should we expose separate microservice endpoints that return database-assigned identifiers so that the coordination layer can make a synchronous call to get an identifier before calling the asynchronous insert? We could use UUIDs but our DBAs hate those as primary keys, and they couldn't be used as an order number or other user-facing generated ids.</p>&#xA;"

All three run as web server exposing JSON REST API.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My questions are these:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p><strong>Can I deploy these servers together in one host running on different ports?</strong>&#xA;If my host get an IP x.x.x.x for example, my gateway can run in x.x.x.x:80, A in port 81, and B in port 82 for example. A and B will talk to a MySQL server somewhere outside or maybe inside the same host. Is this a good practice? Can Continuous Deployment works with this practice?</p></li>&#xA;<li><p><strong>Why should I deploy and run those binaries inside containers like Docker?</strong>&#xA;I know that since its release few years ago, Docker had found its way to be integrated inside a development workflow easily. But of course using Docker is not as simple as just compiling the code into a binary and then moving it to a deployment server. Using Docker we have to put the executable inside the container and then move the container as well to the deployment server.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p><strong>What about scalibility and high availability without using Docker?</strong>&#xA;Can I just replicate my services and run them all at once in different hosts using a load balancer? This way I should deploy A, B, and gateway in one host, and another A, B, and gateway in another host, then setup load balancer in front of them. A, B, and the gateway runs in port 80, 81, and 82 respectively. This way I could have  thousands of nodes in a form of VMs or LXD containers maybe, spread accross hundreds of bare metals, deployed with a simple bash script and ssh, or Ansible if things get complex. Yes or no?</p></li>&#xA;<li><p><strong>And what about the scalability and availability of using Docker?</strong>&#xA;Should I just put all my services inside containers and manage them with something like Kubernetes to achieve high availability? Doing this does add overhead, right? Because the team will have to learn new technology like Kubernetes if they haven't known it yet.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Can you give me an example of some best practices of deploying golang services?</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;"

Hazelcast replicated map is used as a way to replicate data objects (DTOs include several fields) between those micro services. Microservices are hosted on AWS.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There was a problem with data object serialization that's why we created a separated project with custom serialization config. All data objects (java classes) we want to replicate are listed in this config code. Artifact built from this very configuration project is included in each micro service as a maven dependency. This helps to solve serialization problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This solution led us to the new problem what appear if it's needed to add new data object. Firstly we should add this very data object to config project, then rebuild this project. After that, we should rebuild all micro services with updated dependency and redeploy. And if at least one of micro services wasn't rebuilt there will be a serialization error because of this very micro service hazelcast instance doesn't know how to serialize new data object. The process of rebuilding and redeploying all application isn't so convenient for us.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please, share your experience! Is there any way to make it easier? </p>&#xA;"

On ProcessManager Listen to the event and asks for the Resource From ResourceManagement, on Success send Command to LeadAggregate - MarkAsPicked and on this send Push notification to the User that Lead is Picked but from building the UI perspective its very difficult and same cannot be done for exposing our API to third party. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One Sol. we have done is when request is received on Service save a RequestID Vs Request Future . in Command Add the request Id and when the LeadAggregate finally change into Picked State or Picked Failure a PM listen to the event , checks if a RequestFuture is there for the request Id , then complete the future with correct response.

47837207,Entity-level access restriction in the microservice architecture based on user or group membership,2017-12-15 17:31:03,<security><design><architecture><permissions><microservices>,3,982,1,1.0,3,"<p>In the systems, there may be data that is restricted in nature. &#xA;Sometimes access to specific entities should be easily restricted or granted based on user or group membership. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is the best way to implement this in the microservice architecture?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>#1</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Should access control, managing permissions etc. be the responsibility of the microserive itself? Developers will have to implement access control, store, and update permissions for every service. Seems like not very robust and error-prone approach.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>#2</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Create dedicated microservice handling permission management? This service will be called by other microserives to check access permissions for each entity and filtering entities before returning results. Centralized permissions storage and management is an advantage but microservice will have to make a call to ""Permission Service"" for each entity to check access rights what may have a negative influence on performance. And developers still have to integrate access checks into their services what leaves space for an error.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>#3</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Make access control responsibility of the API Gateway or Service Mesh. It is possible to think of an implementation that will automatically filter responses of all services. But in the case when the microservice returns list of entities permissions should be checked for each entity. Still a potential performance problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Example</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Consider the following synthetic example. &#xA;Healthcare system dealing with test results, X-Ray images etc. Health information is very sensitive and should not be disclosed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Test results should be available only to:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>patient</li>&#xA;<li>doctor</li>&#xA;<li>laboratory</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Attending doctor may send the patient to another specialist. A new doctor should have access to test results too. So access can be granted dynamically.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So each entity (e.g. test results, X-Ray image) has a set of rules what users and groups are allowed to access it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Imagine there is a microservice called ""Test Results Service"" dealing with test results. Should it be responsible for access control, manage permissions etc.? Or permissions management should be extracted to separate microservice?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Healthcare system may also handle visits to a doctor. Information about patient's visit to the doctor should be available to:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>patient</li>&#xA;<li>doctor</li>&#xA;<li>clinic receptionist</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the example of a different entity type that requires entity level access restriction based on user or group membership.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It is easy to imagine even more examples when entity level access control is required.</p>&#xA;"

45167593,Authorization of actions across microservices,2017-07-18 13:01:29,<web-services><rest><authorization><microservices><event-sourcing>,2,108,1,1.0,3,"<p>A modern multi-user web application imposes a lot of restrictions on the actions that users can perform. In other words, the actions require authority. For example, a user can only change its own personal data, and only members of a group can post content to that group. In a classic monolith application, such restrictions are easily enforced by joining several database tables and acting according to the results of queries. However, with microservices, it becomes much less clear where and how such limitations should be handled.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the sake of argument, consider a Facebook clone. The whole application consists of several parts:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>A front-end, written in JS and other web technologies</li>&#xA;<li>A backend consisting of a number of microservices</li>&#xA;<li>An API for retrieving and submitting data to the backend, i.e. a gateway</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As for the business logic, there are (among others) two well-known entities:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Events (as in concerts, birthday parties etc.)</li>&#xA;<li>Posts (text entries existing on walls, pages, events etc.)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Suppose that these two entities are managed by separate services, EventService and PostService. Then consider the following constraint:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>A post to an event can be deleted by two kinds of users: the author of the post, and the host(s) of the event.</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In a monolith, this constraint would've been conceptually very easy to deal with. Upon receiving a request to delete a post, supplying the post id and user id,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Fetch the event which the post belongs to.</li>&#xA;<li>Check if the user is the author of the post.</li>&#xA;<li>If yes, delete the post. If not, fetch the hosts of the event.</li>&#xA;<li>Check if the user is among the hosts.</li>&#xA;<li>If yes, delete the post.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, with a microservice strategy, I have a hard time figuring out how to divide the responsibilities of an operation like this across the services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Alternative 1</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>An easy way around it would be to put logic like this in the gateway. That way, the same procedure as described above could essentially be performed, but with calls to the services instead of directly to the database. Rough sketch:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// Given postId and userId&#xA;// Synchronous solution for presentational purposes&#xA;&#xA;const post = postClient('GET', `/posts/${postId}`);&#xA;const hosts = eventClient('GET', `/events/${post.parentId}/hosts`);&#xA;const isHost = hosts.find(host =&gt; host.id == userId);&#xA;&#xA;if (isHost) {&#xA;    postClient('DELETE', `/posts/${postId}`);&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm not happy with this solution. Once I start putting logic like this in the gateway, it'll become very tempting to <em>always</em> do it, as it's a quick and simple way to get things done. All business logic would eventually amass in the gateway, and the services would become ""stupid"" CRUD endpoints. This would defeat the purpose of having separate services with well-defined areas of responsibility.  Furthermore, it could be slow as it could give rise to a high number of calls to the services when operations are getting more complex.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would essentially be reinventing the monolith, replacing database queries with slow and limited network calls.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Alternative 2</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another option would be to allow unlimited communication <em>between</em> services, allowing PostService to simply ask EventService whether the user is a host of the event in question before performing the delete. However, I'm afraid that having a potentially large number of microservices communicating with each other could introduce a lot of coupling in the longer run. Experts seem to generally advise against direct inter-service communication.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Alternative 3</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With a solid system for publishing and subscribing to events, the services could stay updated about what happens in other services. For example, every time a user is promoted to host in EventService, an event would be posted (e.g. <code>events.participant-status-changed, {userId: 14323, eventId: 12321, status: 'host'}</code>). PostService could subscribe to the event and remembering this fact when a request to delete a post is received.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm not quite happy with this one either. It'd create a very intricate and error-prone system, where an unhandled (but potentially rare) event could make services go out of sync. Also, there's a risk that logic would end up in the wrong place. For example, the constraint in this question would be handled by PostService even though conceptually it's a property of the event entity.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I should stress though that I'm very optimistic about the usefulness of events when implementing applications using microservices. I'm just not sure they are the answer to this category of problems.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How would you tackle this hypothetical, but quite realistic difficulty?</p>&#xA;"

However, when thinking deeper into the implementation, there are number of concerns:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>My software has an UI, let's call it a web-based component. This component will need to coordinate/orchestrate calls to 10-20 different microservices internally (let's call it ""private microservices"") and return data to the AJAX call. Is it a good design to couple the orchestration logic in this component? Or should I create another microservice that does the job and the web-based component should be very thin to delegate the call to this microservice?</li>&#xA;<li>I will need to expose some public APIs. Should I have a separate layer to delegate the call like in the case above? </li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I think it might be more or less about the design pattern for public/private microservices. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What would be a good pattern to address the above concerns?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Updated on 9 Apr 2015</strong>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>API Gateway Pattern actually addresses my concerns.

Because my ""Register Service"" depends on ""User service"". They are kind of coupled and this is an anti-pattern of the microservices conception ( from what I read about ).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The second idea was to use a <strong>message broker</strong> like RabbitMQ. ""Register Service"" still insert interesting things into its own database and publish a message in a queue with the user information as data. ""User Service"" consumes this message and persists data into its ""user"" database. By using this conception, both of the services are fully isolated and could be a great idea.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>BUT, <strong>how about the response to send to the client</strong> ( who made the request  to ""Register Service""). With the first idea we could send ""200, everything's ok !"" or 400. It is not a problem. With the second idea, we don't know if the consumer (""User Service"")  persisted the user data, so what do I need to reply to the client ?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have the same problem with the shop side of the web application. The client post the product he wants to buy to ""Order Service"". This one needs to check the virtual money he has into ""User Service"" then forward the product detail to ""Deliver Service"" if the user has enough money. How to do that with fully isolated services ? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I don't want to use the http request time from the client to make async request/reply on the message broker. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I hope some of you will enlighten me.</p>&#xA;"

At this moment I am considering few ways of user authentication flow. I predict following, example user roles:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>admin - is able to create content, upload files etc (admin account can be created only by another admin)</li>&#xA;<li>unauthorized user - can view content</li>&#xA;<li>authorized user - can comment content</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is, how I was thinking about authentication flow so far:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>authentication service - have access to DB with users credentials and permissions</li>&#xA;<li>api gateway - retrieve requests from user, check if user is logged in (ie verifies OAuth2 access token with auth service) and transfer flow to other services based on user request (attaching JWT token with some basic user info)</li>&#xA;<li>another service - accept only requests from api gateway, and trusts user data from JWT token (does not need to connect with auth service to get information about user).</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>After deploying some stuff on AWS infrastructure my way of thinking have changed a little bit. As far as I understand AWS products (Lambda - serverless applications and API gateway), I should implement authentication flow as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>authentication service - gets request from user, retrieve data from dynamoDB and provide user cookie with JWT signed by private key</li>&#xA;<li>any other service - retrieves request with JWT token, verifies signature using public key, and perform some action.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<h1>And now the question comes:</h1>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How deos AWS Cognito fits here? Is it something useful for me? As far as I understand, Cognito simplifies flow of authenticating users via 3rd parties (facebook, twitter etc. etc.). Does AWS Cognito serves login page, separated from my application, or it is only background/webservices impelementation?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So far I am thinking about Cognito as a replacement for my <code>authentication service</code> - any of my services, should impelemnt Cognito authentication flow provided by SDK from amazon, and my static website would implement JavaScript SDK for user login/register.

It will need the <code>userId</code> received in step #1 and a <code>password</code> field from the original request.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This looks pretty straightforward, but what will happen if <code>AuthService</code> is unavailable on step #2? We will need to somehow separate those requests!</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The classic approach is to use the eventual consistency and to create <code>Passport</code> entity via asynchronous call (we can place this request to the queue and process it in separate service). In order to do this we will send an asynchronous request to the <code>AuthService</code> passing <code>userId</code> and <code>password</code> to it, instead of step #2, so the step #1 will immediately return response to the client.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, what if <code>password</code> field is not properly formatted (breaks validation rules)? The validation logic is only present in the <code>AuthService</code>, so we can't know if password is correct until the call is made to it. And now, the request is processed asynchronously, so we can't get back to user and tell him to correct the password.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>SO, how do you properly handle validation in distributed composite requests to microservice application?</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>The naive solution is to move validation logic to the <code>GatewayService</code> itself, but it's a terrible idea, because it will make it fat and will leak business logic from <code>AuthService</code>.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>The other idea is to provide an additional method for password validation and to call it prior to steps #1 and #2. It looks like a viable solution, but it will force us to have two methods for each business method in our microservices, one for prior validation and one for actual operation. Also, there is a time space between validation and operation, so the earlier correct value could become incorrect when operation is actually performed.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>We could split the form in two to avoid composite requests and ask user for password after asking for personal data and creating an account for him. However, this could lead to security problems, where user account could be intercepted by some other party who could guess the next <code>userId</code>. We could, use some additional security token, but it will introduce odd functionality to services and will make the whole setup more complex.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, this approach looks like an attempt to escape the problem, you can't always avoid composite requests.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>We could use full-scale distributed transactions, e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2PC</a>, but it will make the system dramatically complex and will mitigate the use of MSA in the first place.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>And the final idea is to merge those two services together, but it will make no sense in microservice architecture to do so.</p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"

Using the same DB will allow the current application to run as it is, and we can write a new DB Layer, Logic Layer in some Micro Services.

So each part is then isolated with a clearly defined API to interact with for the backend, and its own isolated user interface consuming this API.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, let's say I would like to tie up each of these microservices into a single application. I have two ways (as far as I can see) to do this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>I can configure a server to place each service under a sub-url, and have the application be an array of SPA's, a sort of MPA (Multi Page App). </p></li>&#xA;<li><p>I can create a master app where I set up the routes for each of my micro-apps and load them on demand (custom PreloadingStrategy, I'm looking at you).</p></li>&#xA;<li><p><sup>I also found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39904153/front-end-micro-services-with-angular-2#answer-39937403"" title=""this"">this</a>, a process which I personally don't think highly of, because you'll lose many of the benefits of microservices in a continuous delivery scheme of things.

Service B is a data aggregator that contains a lot of the inventory and what's available.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The user starts creating a shirt, so service A request from service B, what styles/colors are available.

Again service A has to request from service B, what styles/colors are available. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now let's assume within a life cycle of a user session, these styles/colors won't change and we know this is going to be the same data being retrieved over and over again. Not by just this user, but all users. So in this case, since the styles/colors are really part of Service B's domain, they should stay there and live there, or would it be advised to prevent all these needless calls and upon the first request (temporarily) save in Service A the data for the lifecycle of the session to prevent chatty services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is an over-simplified example but the problem remains real-world. Which is more suggested way of architecting this design? &#xA;This usually applies for example when some fairly-static data is passing through some service, and this service will need this data again a few times within the lifecycle of these transactions. So I'm unsure whether the service should just save it temporarily for the life-cycle knowing the data won't change or not caring if it changes within the lifecycle or opt for more chatty services and keep requesting every time.</p>&#xA;"

If I want to use this exact same class in the service I can easily serialize it and send the serialized object in the message body.

There are certain types that are needed by multiple services at the same time and therefore are defined in separate libraries that are imported by whichever needs them (each type is versioned). But there are things about it that make me uncomfortable and I was wondering which are the best practises regarding that topic. In particular:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>I don't know how to handle instances of shared types. In order to avoid orphans the instances must be defined in the type's module for each of the types. But then there are instances that are not needed by all the microservices that import the package and have to be included regardless, potentially adding redundant dependencies to the microservice. An example would be a datatype <strong>T</strong> that is shared by a frontend and a backend. It has an instance of <strong>Store</strong> in order to be stored in a database that is not needed by the frontend, but still makes the frontend depend of the store package.</li>&#xA;<li>In order to avoid the previous issue I could introduce a wrapper every time the type has to ""leave"" a microservice to represent that type going through the wire. In the previous example I would have a <strong>Storable T</strong> which would have an instance for <strong>Store</strong>. This adds quite a lot of overhead to the overall development process though.</li>&#xA;<li>Is it even a good idea to share the types or should each microservice define its own representation of each type, so nothing has to be shared? So for a type <strong>T</strong> a microservice <strong>MA</strong> would have a representation <strong>A.T</strong> and an instance to serialise it in order to send the data to a microservice <strong>B</strong> which would decode that data into a representation <strong>MB.T</strong>.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And finally, regarding the logistical side of the matter,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>What's the most convenient way to structure the project? Would a monorepo be a better choice than having separate repos/submodules?</li>&#xA;<li>Maybe related to the previous one, is there any way to find out automatically which microservices should be redeployed when one of the shared libraries is modified because the changes in the library affect a piece of code that is being used by the microservice?</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;"

I really like the idea of microservices and want to set it up and test it before deciding if I want to use it in production. And then if I do want to use it I want to slowly chip away pieces of my old rails app and move logic to microservices. This I think I can do using HAProxy and set up different routing based on URLs. So this should be covered.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then my next biggest concern is that I don't want too much overhead to ensure everything is running smoothly on the infrastructure side. I want preferrably low configuration and the ease of development, testing and deployment.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, I want to know what are the benefits and downsides of each styles. Akka (cluster) vs something like Kubernetes (maybe even fabric8 on top of it).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I also worry about is fault tolerance. I don't know how do you do that with Kubernetes. Do you then have to include some message queue to ensure your messages don't get lost? And then also have multiple queue if one of the queues goes down? Or just retry until queue comes up again? Akka actors already have that right? Retrying and mail boxes? What are the strategies for fault tolerance for microservices? Do they differ for each approach?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Someone please enlighten me! ;)</p>&#xA;"

A command sent to a microservice triggers an application state change and the emission of the corresponding event on our Kafka bus. We project these events in a read model built with ElasticSearch.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So far, so good.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our microservices are eventually consistent with each other. But at any given time, they aren't (necessarily). Consequently, the events they send are not always consistent with each other either.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Moreover, to guarantee the coherence between an application state change and the emission of the corresponding event, we persist in DB the new state and the corresponding event in the same transaction (I am aware that we could use event sourcing and avoid persisting the state altogether). An asynchronous worker is then responsible to send these events on the Kafka bus. This pattern guarantees that at least one event will be sent for each state change (which is not an issue since our events are idempotent). However, since each microservice has its own event table and asynchronous worker, we cannot guarantee that events will be sent in the sequence in which the corresponding state changes occurred in their respective microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: to clarify, each microservice has its own database, its own event table and its own worker. A specific worker processes the events in the order in which they were persisted in its corresponding event table, but different workers on different event tables, i.e. for distinct microservices, do not give such guarantee.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem arises when projecting these incoherent or out-of-sequence events from different microservices in the same ElasticSearch document.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A concrete example: let's imagine three different aggregates A, B and C (aggregate in the Domain Driven Design sense) managed by different microservices:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>There is a many-to-many relation between A and B. Aggregate A references the aggregate roots B he is bound to, but B is unaware of its relationships with A. When B is deleted, the microservice managing A listens for the corresponding event and undoes the binding of A with B.</li>&#xA;<li>Similarily, there is a many-to-many relation between B and C. B knows of all related C aggregates, but the inverse is not true. When C is deleted, the microservice managing B listens for the corresponding event and undoes the binding of B with C.</li>&#xA;<li>C has a property ""name"".</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One of the use cases is to find, through ElasticSearch, all aggregates A that are bound to an aggregate B that is in turn bound to an aggregate C with a specific name.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As explained above, the separate event tables and workers could introduce variable delays between the emission of events from different microservices. Creating A, B and C and binding them together could for example result in the following sequence of events:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>B created</li>&#xA;<li>B bound to C</li>&#xA;<li>C created with name XYZ</li>&#xA;<li>A created</li>&#xA;<li>A bound to B</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another example of batch of events: let's suppose we initially have aggregates B and C and two commands are issued simultaneously:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>delete C</li>&#xA;<li>bind B to C</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>this could result in the events:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>C deleted</li>&#xA;<li>B bound to C</li>&#xA;<li>B unbound from C (in response to event 1)</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Concretely, we have trouble projecting these events in ElasticSearch document(s) because the events sometimes reference aggregates that do not exist anymore or do not exist yet.

I'm also assuming that each developer will create a fork of any repo that they are working on. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The issue I'm considering arises where you are working on an issue that involves multiple micro-services. For example, there is a defect that impacts one micro service and how it appropriately consumes another micro-service. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Assuming n projects are involved in the defect, you would have to check out n git repositories and configure them to work together. If they each have a Vagratefile and Dockerfile, you end up running n VMs. Ideally you'd only have 1 Vagrant VM and each serivce would just be a new Docker instance in that same VM.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A master repo/project with git sub modules could work. The problem with that is if we create a generic master repo/project then the sub module will point to the upstream not the fork for the developer.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm currently thinking that a master project that had some configs, vagrant and fig might do the trick.

Our microservices will be wrapped in Docker containers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We have already deployed containers and configured the auto-scaling and the load balancing.

I feel pretty good about the size and granularity of the individual services, with the exception or our security service.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have three main services, let's say <code>foo-service</code>, <code>bar-service</code>, and <code>baz-service</code>. These services never need to communicate, but all three services regularly talk via HTTP requests to the <code>security-service</code>. I want this to stop for a variety of reasons- the biggest is that each request to my individual services spawns a request to the security service, which can turn into several extra hops once you account for load balancing, etc. I've been reading ""Software Architecture Patterns"" by Mark Richards, and he recommends in these instances you should share databases and violate DRY: copy the required functionality into each service. Still, he uses this example with smaller ""utility"" classes, which may not really apply in this instance. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The security service isn't that big, so I could definitely copy it into each of the other services. That said, it's just big enough that I don't feel great copying and pasting it - 314 'relevant' lines of code according to coveralls (java so there's a lot more actual code ;-). I could easily turn it into a module that each service brings in- but then my services have a shared dependency and that has bit me in the past. Of course the security code will grow over time as we add authentication methods, but we aren't reinventing the wheel when it comes to auth so It's mostly integrating with other libraries and authentication services. That is, I don't imagine this particular code base getting huge.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question, should I copy and paste the code or build a module that every service brings in? Thanks!</p>&#xA;"

In a naively-built system, that would mean the changes persist but the event detailing them will never be published.  I've pondered the following ideas to create better guarantees, but I'm not quite sure of all the pros and cons of each:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A:  Use an embedded database (like SQLite) in my microservice instance to track the full transaction, from the commit to the main database to the event publishing.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>B:  Create an Events table in my main database, using database transactions to insert the Event and commit the relevant changes at the same time.  The service would then push the Event to the bus, and then make another commit to the main database to mark the Event as Published.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>C:  As above, create an Events table in my main database, using database transactions to insert the Event and commit the relevant changes at the same time.  Then, notify (either manually via REST/Messages from within the service or via database hooks) a dedicated EventPusher service that a new event has been appended.  The EventPusher service will query the Events table and push the events to the bus, marking each one as Published upon acknowledgement.  Should a certain amount of time pass without any notification, the EventPusher will do a manual query.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What are the pros and cons of each of the choices above?

So every time a student is created a licensing check has to be made. There are multiple types of licenses so the type of the license would have to be included in the operation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is which approach have you found is better in practice:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Build a composite service that calls the 2 services</li>&#xA;<li>Coupling student-service to licensing-service so that when createStudent is called the student-service makes a call to licensing-service and only when that completes will the student be created</li>&#xA;<li>Use an event-based architecture</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>People talk about microservice architectures being more like a graph than a hierarchy and <strong>option 1</strong> kinda turns this into a hierarchy where you get increasingly coarse composites. Other downsides is it creates confusion as to what service clients should actually use and there's some duplication going on because the composites API would have to include all of the parameters that are needed to call the downstream services.&#xA;It does have a big benefit because it gives you a natural place to do failure handling, choreography and handle consistency.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Option 2</strong> seems like it has disadvantages too:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>the API of licensing would have to leak into the student API so that you can specify licensing restrictions. </p></li>&#xA;<li><p>it puts a lot of burden on the student-service because it has to handle consistency across all of the dependent services</p></li>&#xA;<li>as more services need to react when a student is created I could see the dependency graph quickly getting out of control and the service would have to handle that complexity in addition to the one from its own logic for managing students.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Option 3</strong> While being decoupling heaven, I don't really think would work because this is all triggered from an UI and people aren't really used to ""go do something else until this new student shows up"" approach.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you </p>&#xA;"

This is all fine and gives us great flexibility in keeping UI and backend logic separate and lowering the amount of dependencies.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>BUT!</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There is an important part of our business that has a growing headache as a result of this, namely reporting.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since we make sure that there is no data replication (and business logic sharing) between services, then each service knows its own data and if another service really needs to keep a reference for that data, they do it through ID's (entity linking, essentially). And while otherwise its great, it's not great for reporting.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our business often needs to create ad-hoc reports about specific instances happening with our customers. In the 'old days' you made a simple SQL query that joined a couple of database tables and queried whatever you needed, but it is not possible with decoupled services. And this is a problem as business sees it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am personally not a fan of data replication for reporting purposes in the back end, as that may have another tendency to grow into a nightmare (which it already is even in our legacy monoliths). So this problem is really not about legacy monoliths versus modern microservices, but about data dependencies in general.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Have you faced issues like this and if yes, then how did you solve it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We have been discussing in-house the few potential solutions how to solve this, but none of them are actually good and I've not gotten the answer I am looking for yet that solves the issues in large scale.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>Good old replicate-everything-and-let-BI-people-figure-it-out is what is still used to this day. From the old monolith times the BI/data-warehouse team made duplicates of all databases, but same practice is more inconvenient, but still done to this day for all microservices that use a database. This is not good for various reasons and comes with the shared sandbox cancer you can expect.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Build a separate microservice or a set of microservices that are meant for fetching out specific reports. Each of them connect to set microservices that carries the relevant data and builds the report as expected. This introduces tighter coupling however and can be incredibly complicated and slow with large datasets.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Build a separate microservice or a set of microservices that each have databases replicated from other databases in background. This is problematic as team databases are being coupled and data is directly replicated and there is a strong dependency on technology of databases that is being used.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Have each service send out an event to RabbitMQ that BI services would pick up on and then fetch additional data, if needed. It sounds by far the best for me, but by far the most complex to implement as all services need to start publishing relevant data. It is what I would personally choose at present time, from a very abstract level, that is.</p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"

40938088,Microservices in practice,2016-12-02 17:44:43,<spring><docker><cloud><microservices><docker-swarm>,1,387,1,1.0,6,"<p>I have studied concept of microservices for a good while now, and understand what they are are and why they are necessary.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Quick refresher</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In a nutshell, monolith application is decomposed into independent deployable units, each of which typically exposes it's own web API and has it's own database. Each service fulfills a single responsibility and does it well. These services communicates over synchronous web services such as REST or SOAP, or using asynchronous messaging such as JMS to fulfill some request in synergy. Our monolith application has became a distributed system. Typically all these fine grained APIs are made available through an API gateway or proxy, which acts as an single-point-of-entry facade, performing security and monitoring related tasks.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Main reasons to adapt microservices is high availability, zero downtime update and high performance achieved via horizontal scaling of a particular service, and looser coupling in the system, meaning easier maintenance. Also, IDE functionality, build and deployment process will be significantly faster, and it's easier to change framework or even the language.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Microservices goes hand in hand with clustering and containerization technologies, such as Docker. Each microservice could be packed as a docker container to run it in any platform. Principal concepts of clustering are <em>service discovery</em>, <em>replication</em>, <em>load balancing</em> and <em>fault tolerance</em>. Docker Swarm is a clustering tool which orchestrates these containerized services, glues them together, and handles all those tasks under the hood in a declarative manner, maintaining the desired state of the cluster.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sounds easy and simple in theory, but I still don't understand how to implement this in practice, even I know Docker Swarm pretty well. Let's view an concrete example.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Here is the question</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm building a simplistic java application with <em>Spring Boot</em>, backed by <em>MySQL</em> database. I want to build a system, where user gets a webpage from <em>Service A</em> and submits a form. <em>Service A</em> will do some manipulation to data and sends it to <em>Service B</em>, which will further manipulate data, write to database, return something and in the end some response is sent back to user.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now the problem is, <em>Service A</em> doesn't know where to find <em>Service B</em>, nor <em>Service B</em> know where to find <em>database</em> (because they could be deployed at any node in the cluster), so I don't know how I should configure the Spring boot application. First thing to come in my mind is to use DNS, but I can't find tutorials how to setup such a system in docker swarm. What is the correct way to configure connection parameters in Spring for distributed cloud deployment? I have researched about Spring Cloud project, but don't understand if it's the key for this dilemma.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm also confused how databases should be deployed. Should they live in the cluster, deployed alongside with the service (possibly with aid of docker compose), or is it better to manage them in more traditional way with fixed IP's?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Last question is about load balancing. I'm confused if there should be multiple load balancers for each service, or just a single master load balancer. Should the load balancer has a static IP mapped to a domain name, and all user requests target this load balancer? What if load balancer fails, doesn't it make all the effort to scale the services pointless? Is it even necessary to setup a load balancer with Docker Swarm, as it has it's own routing mesh? Which node end user should target then?</p>&#xA;"

41161769,Authorisation in microservices - how to approach domain object or entity level access control using ACL?,2016-12-15 10:22:31,<spring><security><authorization><acl><microservices>,1,948,2,1.0,6,"<p>I am currently building microservices based system on java Spring Cloud. Some microservices use PostgreSQL and some of them MongoDB. REST and JMS is used for communication. The plan is to use SSO and OAuth2 for authentication</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The challenge I am facing is that authorisation have to be done on domain object/entity level. It means some kind of ACL (Access Control List) is needed. The best practice for this kind of architecture is to avoid something like this and have coarse grained security probably on application/service layer level in every microservice but unfortunately it is not possible.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My final idea is to use Spring Security ACL and have the ACL tables in shared database between all microservices. The database would be accessed only by Spring infrastructure or through Spring api. The DB schema looks stable and unlikely will change. In this case I would simply break the rule about sharing db between microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I was considering different kinds of distributed solutions but left them: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>One microservice with ACL and accessing it using rest - The problem is too many http calls and performance degradation. I would have to extend Spring Security ACL to replace db access by rest calls</li>&#xA;<li>ACL in every microservice for its own entities - Sounds quite reasonable but imagine a case having some read models of entities synchronised to some other microservices or same entity that exists in different bounded contexts (different microservices). ACLs can become really unmanageable and can be source of errors.</li>&#xA;<li>One microservice with ACL tables that are synchronised to other microservices as a read model. The problem is that there is no support in Spring Security ACL for MongoDB. I have seen some custom solutions on github and yes it is doable. But...when creating a new entity I have to create record in the microservice  that owns ACL and then it is asynchronously synchronised as a read model to microservice owning the entity. It does not sound as a easy solution</li>&#xA;<li>Choose some URL based access control on API gateway. But I would have to modify Spring Security ACL somehow. The API gateway would have to know too much about other services. Granularity of access control is bound to REST api granularity. Maybe I can not imagine all the consequences and other problems that would this approach bring</li>&#xA;<li>Finally the solution with shared db that I mentioned is my favorite. Actually it was the first one I have disqualified because it is “shared” database. But after going through possibilities it seemed to me that this is the only one that would work. There is some more additional complexity in case I would like to use some kind of caching because distributed cache would be needed.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would really use some advice and opinions how to approach the architecture because this is really tricky and a lot of things can go wrong here.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Many thanks,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Lukas</p>&#xA;"

Like somehow talk directly within the private network? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One way I thought of is multiple levels of API gateway. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>1 public API gateway</li>&#xA;<li>1 private API gateway per microservice. And each microservice can call another microservice ""directly"" inside the private network</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But in this way, I need to ""duplicate"" my routes in 2 levels of API ... this does not seem ideal. I was thinking maybe use <code>{proxy+}</code>. So anything <code>/payment/{proxy+}</code> goes to payment API gateway and so on - theres still 2 levels of API gateway ... but this seem to be the best I can go? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Maybe there is a better way? </p>&#xA;"

It is possible to have a fine grained control of connection requirements for each service.But, down side is that as the number of services increase, number of connection pool also increases and eventually there will be too many idle connections assuming that minimum connections in each pool is greater than 0.</li>&#xA;<li>Rely on database specific extensions like PGBouncer - This approach has the advantage that connection pool is managed by a central source rather than a pool for each micro service and hence number of idle connections can be brought down. It is also language/technology agnostic. Down side is that these extensions are database specific and some of the functionalities in JDBC may not work. For eg: Prepared statments may not work with PGBouncer in Transaction_Pooling mode. </li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In our case most of the micro-services(at least 50) will be connecting to the same Postgres server even though the database can be different. So, if we go with option 1, there is a higher chance of creating too many idle connections.The traffic to most of our services are very moderate and the rationale behind moving to micro-service is for easier deployment, scaling etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Has anyone faced a similar problem while adopting micro-services architecture? Is there a better way of solving this problem in micro-service world?</p>&#xA;"
32334161,What is the conceptual difference between Service Discovery tools and Load Balancers that check node health?,2015-09-01 14:24:24,<load-balancing><distributed-computing><microservices><service-discovery><consul>,3,414,3,6.0,8,"<p>Recently several service discovery tools have become popular/""mainstream"", and I’m wondering under what primary use cases one should employ them instead of traditional load balancers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With LBs, you cluster a bunch of nodes behind the balancer, and then clients make requests to the balancer, who then (typically) round robins those requests to all the nodes in the cluster.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With service discovery (<a href=""https://www.consul.io"" rel=""noreferrer"">Consul</a>, <a href=""https://zookeeper.apache.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">ZK</a>, etc.), you let a centralized “consensus” service determine what nodes for particular service are healthy, and your app connects to the nodes that the service deems as being healthy. <strong>So while service discovery and load balancing are two separate concepts, service discovery gives you load balancing as a convenient side effect.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, if the load balancer (say <a href=""http://www.haproxy.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">HAProxy</a> or <a href=""http://wiki.nginx.org/Main"" rel=""noreferrer"">nginx</a>) has monitoring and health checks built into it, then you pretty much get service discovery as a side effect of load balancing! Meaning, if my LB knows not to forward a request to an unhealthy node in its cluster, then that’s functionally equivalent to a consensus server telling my app not to connect to an unhealty node.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So to me, service discovery tools feel like the “6-in-one,half-dozen-in-the-other” equivalent to load balancers. Am I missing something here? If someone had an application architecture entirely predicated on load balanced microservices, what is the benefit (or not) to switching over to a service discovery-based model?</p>&#xA;"

The project has been frozen for months, but it's quite advanced, the whole application run inside the same container under glassfish, so it's a monolith.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My application has an user interface and its purpose is to offer them the possibility to organize urls to tutorials (any kinds) as cards, with tags for the classification, into folders. So any user has its own tree, they can make a research inside the other users's tree create a link on a file in their own tree, copy a entire folder, reorganize it etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Nowedays we hear a lot about microservices, Spring boot, Angular Js, react etc. I like to develop with JSF it's a great framework, but I'm asking myself about refactoring my application, at least the necessary parts into microservices, and if JSF is appropriate for that or if I should user other tools.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I like for example with JSF is the facility to create views, its component approach, and how it handle the full cycle of a request.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example with a simple folder creation form :</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have to choose the parent folder, so I can bind a research component to a backing bean that makes a research indirectly in my DB using a DAO ( in my app an EJB using JPA). That happens at the ""invoke application"" phase and refresh my form list with ajax at the end. When I submit the form I can also bind a converter to the research component to retrieve directly a Folder object, the converter uses also a DAO to retrieve the object that I need at the ""Invoke application"" phase to finish the job.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I also use validators to control different attributes of a new folder, usually I declare them inside my entity class (Folder, User ...) with annotations like @NotNull etc. Before I save the folder on my db, I also check the user rights to see if he can write inside the parent folder and so on. I do that inside the backing bean, so at the 'invoke application' phase, and return a faces message if anything happens wrong.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I read about micro-services I see that you can use them directly inside a form using json for communication, so it seems quite different. For example if I have a micro-service for the CRUD operations of my folders, are the validators, the converters, part of the service or are they stand alone services ? And what about the security checks ? that kind of architecture is quite mysterious to me.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>ps : English is not my mother tongue so be indulgent please :)</p>&#xA;"

Then, the API Gateway interacts with the necessary services and sends the response back.&#xA;Here is one example in practice: a service sends a request to a custom (endpoint) connector, the request is parsed, broken down into smaller requests that are sent to other services (that own the specific content requested), get the content back in the response, gather all the responses, create a final response with all the content gathered, send the response back to the first service that sent a request.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I need high availability, scalibility, fault tolerance, the ability to monitor and test all services in one place, ability to do canary testing, easy to add new services and manage the older services. I value open source software and mature software. Should run off premise.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The best solutions that I believe would solve my problem are: WSO2, Apigee, Zuul and Amazon API Gateway. I don't know which is more appropriate for my use case. I have looked at others, but I haven't found any advantages in features or cost against these 4.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you for your feedback regarding advantages and disadvantages regarding these technologies! Other suggestions are also welcome!</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Notes:&#xA;Not all of my services are on AWS, but some are.&#xA;The system needs to handle peaks with tens of thousands of requests per minute that happen regurarly, but never continuasly.</p>&#xA;"
41293238,High Availability Websockets Server,2016-12-22 23:39:48,<.net><websocket><microservices><high-availability>,1,178,0,0.0,-1,"<p>I want to know the best way to set up a WebSockets server in a high availability (.NET Core) microservices infrastructure.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My current plan is to have two instances of my WebSockets server behind a load balancer, with session affinity so that once a connection is open, subsequent messages return to the same instance. Then if an instance fails, the client will reconnect to another instance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this the best way to set it up or is there a better way? My primary concern is high availability, but I also want to be able to scale horizontally.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also if a message needs to be broadcast to a browser client then should I use some kind of reliable message queue to be sure that all instances of the WebSockets server know about the message, in case they own the connection to that browser client? The alternative I thought of for this is that if the servers are somehow stateless, with the connection information stored somewhere else (Redis cluster?) then I wouldn't need to notify all the instances because none of them would ""own"" the connection to that client?

Development time is not important to me since this is for my own personal project and learning to use the right tool for the problem is more important to me than the development time required to build the service.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The more I think about it, the more I think that Elixir should be used 90% of the time. The reason is twofold: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1) concurrency implies many users can hit the service without fail</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) most microservices have 0 processing overhead, they hit a database and return a json. I.e. the gains from hitting a database with a faster language are not differentiable from using a slower language. The database in question will determine the speed at which data is returned, not the server language since the database implementation will itself be written in lower language like C++. (Is this true? Will Elixir + Postgresql be noticably slower than Go + Postgresql? Or even Ruby + Postgresql? Is the bottleneck Postgresql or the language making the request?)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Assuming the above 2 are true, then it stands to reason to me that I would use Elixir 90% of the time because I would get a service that is future-proofed to traffic spikes and since it will generally have the same speed of execution as any other database retrieval Rest APIs. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The other 10% of the time where a service requires processor speed like  an Image Recognition service I would then implement in C++ or in Python because it has libraries already implemented in C++ for Image Recognition (ie Tensor Flow).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this a correct way of thinking about when to use specific languages for a microservice? If not, besides Development Time what else should I consider? </p>&#xA;"

So for now I need to wait until the application and sales micro service is finished, so I can show the beta version to the user and apply any other type of testing.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sprint 2:&#xA;<br>&#xA;   - Develop sales micro service.&#xA;<br>&#xA;   - Develop application.&#xA;<br>&#xA;End of Sprint 2</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now that all the components needed are finished to accomplish the user requirements, we can continue with the pipeline. applying  all the testing needed before we show a beta version to the user.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the million dollar question is, how would you do this scenario with Jenkins and GitLab?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I understand that micro services should be independent to every component in the system, but at the end the entire system depends on each other, for example if I add a new micro service like ""shipping"", this new functionality should be seen in the application interface, so it means that before releasing the new system I have a dependency on ""shipping"" micro service and the application interface, because without both developments I cant fully test the user requirements before deploying to production.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>P.S. I'm sorry for any confusion in this post, but I complety new at this topic.</p>&#xA;"

The thing is, those are the only parts I need, I don't need spidering/parsing/orm/etc. Looking at the docs, it was unclear how I would seperate out just these components. I need a microservice for just these parts of what scrapy does. The Flask to Scrapy's Django.

This API allow you to fetch, using a GET request, the data stored in a mysql database.&#xA;Now I need to import a lot of data in the same database (creating every time a new table).

41171413,Docker in docker and docker compose block one port for no reason,2016-12-15 18:55:41,<docker><docker-compose><microservices>,1,120,0,0.0,-1,"<p>Right now I am setting up an application that has a deployment based upon docker images.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I use gitlab ci to:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Test each service</li>&#xA;<li>Build each service</li>&#xA;<li>Dockerize each image (create docker container)</li>&#xA;<li>Run integration tests (start docker compose that starts all services on special ports, run integration tests)</li>&#xA;<li>Stop prod images and run new images</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I did this for each service, but I ran into an issue.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I start my docker container for integration tests then it is setup within a gitlab ci task. For each task a docker based runner is used. I also mount my host docker socket to be able to use docker in docker.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my gradle docker image is started by the gitlab runner. Then docker will be installed and all images will be started using docker compose.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One microservice listens to port 10004. Within the docker compose file there is a 11004:10004 port mapping. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My integration tests try to connect to port 11004. But this does not work right now.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I attach to the image that run docker compose while it tries to execute the integration test then I am not able to do it manually by calling</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>wget ip: port &#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I just get the message connected and waiting for response. Either my tests can connect successfully. My service does not log any message about a new connection.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I execute this <code>wget</code> command within  my host shell then it works.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It's a public ip and within my container I can also connect to other ports using <code>telnet</code> and <code>wget</code>. Just one port of one service is broken when I try to connect from my docker in docker instance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I do not use docker compose then it works. Docker compose seems to setup a special default network that does something weird.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Setting network to host also works...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So did anyone also make such an experience when using docker compose?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The same setup works flawless in docker for mac, but my server runs on Debian 8.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My solution for now is to use a shell runner to avoid docker in docker issues. It works there as well.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So docker in docker combined with docker compose seems to have an ugly bug.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm writing while I am sitting in the subway but I hope describing my issue is also sufficient to talk about experiences. I don't think we need some sourcecode to find bad configurations because it works without docker in docker and on Mac.</p>&#xA;"

45598647,Microservice between my own application and a logging application to structure logging,2017-08-09 18:56:37,<c#><microservices>,2,307,4,0.0,-1,<p>I'm trying to find a good example which explains me how I can build a micro-service that I can put between my own application and a logging application like seq. In this way I'll try to put the logging data in the same destination an I can switch easily from those logging application so I don't have to edit my entire code. Is there a way to do this and maybe a example which explains this. I've already googled for it but I didn't found any clear explanations.</p>&#xA;
