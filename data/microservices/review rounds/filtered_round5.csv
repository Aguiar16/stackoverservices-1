39932500,Microservices with Spring-Boot and Release Management,<spring-boot><microservices><spring-boot-maven-plugin>,1,485,5,1.0,0,"<p>Looking for advice in how to do release management of microservices built with Spring Boot. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Most projects I've worked use the release plugin (maven) to create tags as well as to release maven projects (jar, war, rpm). Usually, this relies on the maven parent/child relationship for all sub-projects (jars, wars) during the release process (monolith source code, all living in a single git repository). I'm wondering how do people maintain different boot projects (microservices) and make releases.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The way I see it, the following are possible strategies:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>One Spring Boot project (microservice maven project) per git repository so that releases are managed independently. </li>&#xA;<li>A Multi-Module maven project with each module being a microservice. All submodules (microservices) will have to be released together. The parent pom will have to use a Boot's parent pom. </li>&#xA;<li>Rely on the maven-release-plugin ability to release only certain sub-modules based on a release. This will make each maven sub-module have different versions (potentially).</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What has your team found useful?

40108015,Microservice's High availability concern on cloud,<cloud><microservices>,1,230,3,0.0,0,"<p>I was reading about Microservices and everything makes sense to me but I have one little doubt.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>On cloud, every component has a availability SLA (lets assume 99.9%). So, if we have a single component to do a job, our application SLA would be the same (approx.). But if we create multiple components to do one job, our application's SLA would be reduced because all the components can go down at different time. In microservices, one service can communicate to other services to complete a task. Now, any of the participant service can be down at different time, So our application availability will be lesser compared to monolithic service?</p>&#xA;"

Allow me to explain the use case, my solution to it and, ask for your opinion as a subject matter expert.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Use Case</strong>:&#xA;We've several Microservices that all return some form of content from different business domains. We're using Spring Cloud Netflix, so a gateway service routes traffic to the content services. Some, if not all, of these services require data that is derived from the request, and is immutable. A trivial example is locale, although there are other proprietary information too.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Solution</strong>:&#xA;I'm currently deriving the shared data in the gateway service and persisting as JSON in a NoSQL database with a unique key. Then I'm adding the key as a request header before routing the request. I've a shared library that the content services include at build time, and includes a Spring bean that reads the key from the request header, fetches the stored data using the key and initializes itself. This makes it possible for the content services to access the shared data (by simply injecting the previously mentioned bean) without knowing the underlying mechanism.&#xA;If a content service invokes another one, it's responsible for adding the unique key as a request header.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Debate</strong>:&#xA;The debate I've with my colleagues is that whether using a shared datastore for this purpose is appropriate. I contend that it is bad for a service to leak it's domain specific data to others, but the data in question isn't domain specific, so there's nothing wrong with having a shared database and passing the key around. The alternative would be to pass all the shared data around which I consider redundant.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is your thought?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I see someone voted to close the question. Unless they can point me to a reference that discusses data sharing among Microservices, such policing is a hindrance to meaningful discussion.

It would be really great if you could give me a hint or an advice how you would handle this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Because these question are not directed to a specific project, I try to make it as clear as possible with the following example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let‘s assume you want to build some kind of Youtube channel observer, that logs different kinds of channel‘s (meta-)data (videos, hourly views/sub count, currently subscribed to), that are imported in a specific time interval.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So there are two major features the app has to offer, which should form a microservice each:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Add/remove channels to be watched (=> manager service)</li>&#xA;<li>import information (=> import service)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Both services provide an API to communicate with each other.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The manager service is connected to a database which contains the channels that need to be watched, with their basic information (name, contact, ...) and the channels these observed channels are currently subscribed to, whereas the import service has a database containing all the other more time-series oriented information (videos, hourly views/sub count).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To add a channel only the channel url has to specified. All the other information (name, contact, ...) are added by the import service (but can also be modified by the user).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>All in all the import service is totally useless without the information of the manager service, but also the manager service can only show the user specified channel information (worst case: only channel url) if no import service is available. In total: they depend heavily on each other.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So much for the general architecture. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem I have here is, that the import service depends on the data in the manager service database to such a great degree and also modifies it:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Would it be a good idea to share the manager service database between these two services or should it only be accessible by the provided API?</li>&#xA;<li>No matter if database is shared or not: both services need model classes for the channel.

40413453,Aggregated Notification Microservice,<microservices>,1,728,1,0.0,1,"<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We are currently architecting our new Notification Microservice but having trouble with how to handle aggregated emails. What we need to do is instead of sending one email every action performed (could be 20+ in a few minutes), we would send an email after an hour summarising all the actions that were completed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>What We Have So Far</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We so far propose that we have this type of messaging pattern, where Client Service is any service in our cluster and Messagebot is our Notification Microservice.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Client Service sends a notification to Messagebot that it will need to send something in the future</li>&#xA;<li>Messagebot stores the details in its database</li>&#xA;<li>Messagebot periodically checks its database for what needs to be sent</li>&#xA;<li>Messagebot gets the required data from another service (could be Client Service) via API</li>&#xA;<li>Messagebot sends email using the data from #3 and an HTML template</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>The Debate</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the data that needs to be sent, we are less sure and it is what we need help with. So far we think this should be the structure of the JSON from Client Service to Notification Service (step #1):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{&#xA;    template_id: SOME_TEMPLATE_ID,&#xA;    user_id: SOME_USER_ID,&#xA;    objectid: SOME_OBJECT_ID&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>or</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{&#xA;    template_id: SOME_TEMPLATE_ID,&#xA;    user_id: SOME_USER_ID,&#xA;    required_objects: { task_id: SOME_TASK_ID, document_id: SOME_DOCUMENT_ID }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where task_id and document_id are just examples and it would change based on the template. It could just as easily be <code>{product_id: SOME_PRODUCT_ID}</code> for a different template.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Why The Debate</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our thoughts so far are that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>We only need template_id because the source of the data would be implied in the objects (like an ENV var). For example, the Task object would be at <a href=""http://taskservice/:id"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://taskservice/:id</a>. Otherwise, we can have problems with failing APIs or switching URLs in the future.</li>&#xA;<li>We should use userid instead of email and name because we prevent the issue of email/ name pairs not matching up over multiple messages</li>&#xA;<li>For the objects, we're still sceptical because it means that the client app service would need knowledge of the inner workings in Messagebot but a single objectid might not be very extensible. We could easily imagine many of our messages needing more than one object.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you for reading. The design of this service is important because it will be central to our entire organisation. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which debated JSON structure is most appropriate in our situation? Also, knowing our requirements, what would be the proper setup for this type of service? (aka. Are we correct in our other assumptions?)</p>&#xA;"

42353292,Does Service Discovery microservice break idea of loose coupling?,<microservices><service-discovery>,4,120,0,1.0,1,"<p>As a mechanism to connect microservices together and make them work it is usually suggested to use APIs and Service Discovery. But they usually work as their own microservices, but these ones should apparently be ""hard-coded"" into others, as every microservice is supposed to register with them and query for other microservices' locations. Doesn't this break the idea of loose coupling, since a loss of a discovery service implies others being unable to communicate?</p>&#xA;"

41086281,MICROSERVICES - communication between them,<java><rest><microservices>,2,712,4,0.0,1,"<p>I've got one question concerning microservices architecture. I am designing a system based on microservices. I've read few articles and I think I understand the idea. However, I don't how microservices should communicate with each other while they have separate business responsibilities....&#xA;What I mean is that if I have a system for booking train tickets, I would divide backend application into modules: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Client (login,logout,registration) </li>&#xA;<li>Reservations (booking a train seat for user,getting all reservations for user) </li>&#xA;<li>ConnectionsDetails&#xA;(searching for connections,getting connection details) </li>&#xA;<li>Trains&#xA;(information about trains- seats number,class etc.)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, I can only think that if user search for connections module ConnectionsDetails communicate with Trains module and ask about particular train details. But how could other microservices communicate? If user wants to login - she/he asks directly Client module, if she/he wants to get all her reservations - asks Reservation module DIRECTLY etc... </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question is, how should modules communicate if they do different things? I'm sorry if my question is trivial or stupid, I'm just starting with microservices.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT:&#xA;I didn't mean what tools could I use for communication. My question is about logic. In the example I showed, why one microservice could ask another microservice about sth if client can directly ask the another one? As I said earlier, how they should communicate(about what should they ask each other exactly) if they do separate things?</p>&#xA;"

This has the consequence that you consume your own messages and have to filter them. I would consider this a dirty solution, but easy for new new consumers to get all unit status events.</li>&#xA;<li>Create a specific topic for each status, for example <code>unit-status-created</code>, <code>unit-status-packaged</code>, <code>unit-status-loaded</code>, <code>unit-status-deleted</code>, etc. Each service produces only on it's own topic, but can consume from a list of topics, excluding it's own. For example the loading service would consume from list(<code>unit-status-created</code>, <code>unit-status-deleted</code>, <code>unit-status-packaged</code>). This allows services to show interest in only specific events, but it requires a code or config change in potentially all service when a new status topic is added. </li>&#xA;<li>Give each status it's own partition and consume from all partitions except the one you produce in. This design makes things more complicated (bookkeeping which partition contains a specific status), does not auto balance when partitions are added, adding partitions while live makes things a bit more risky, therefore does not have my preference. </li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"

32887039,How to implement HATEOAS in a Spring-Boot microservices project,<java><spring><rest><microservices><spring-hateoas>,1,488,5,0.0,2,"<p>Lately I've been experimenting with building <strong>microservices</strong> using the Java <strong>Spring Boot</strong> framework. I currently have a working Microservices systeem with several resources (which all have its own independent service), e.g.: A Book service and a Review service.&#xA;Each service has its own <strong>RestController</strong> and uses a <strong>MongoRepository</strong> to interact with its database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The end-users of the application (web-clients) will not communicate with these independent services itself but with an API above them.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This API calls the book and review services, merges the data and returns it back to the client. Note that all the communication is using <code>ResponseEntity&lt;T&gt;</code> (<code>T</code> can be <code>Book</code>, <code>Review</code>, <code>Iterable&lt;Book&gt;</code>, etc, ..)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But after reading a while I learnt about <strong>HATEOAS</strong> and I would like to use it in my microservices set-up. Now my question is, what is the best way to implement this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Some examples I've found extend the entity classes (which in my case would be the Book entity or the Review entity with Spring's <code>ResourceSupport</code> class). But this causes errors since my entity's have an ID parameter and the <code>getId()</code> method clashes with the <code>getId()</code> method of the ResourceSupport class. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Other examples contain a <code>MongoRepository</code> annotated with <code>@RestResource</code> instead of using a <strong>Controller</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question is, what would in this case be the best way to implement HATEOAS? And e.g. when the Book service adds links (the HATEOAS way), how can the API above change these links? Since the end-users will only do calls to this API and the API just processes these requests and delegates it to the necesarry sub-services.</p>&#xA;"

32574103,Microservices - how to solve security and user authentication?,<authentication><java-ee><microservices>,2,1504,1,2.0,3,"<p>There is a lot of discussion about microservice architecture. What I am missing - or maybe what I did not yet understand is, how to solve the issue of security and user authentication?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example: I develop a microservice which provides a Rest Service interface to a workflow engine. The engine is based on JEE and runs on application servers like GlassFish or Wildfly. &#xA;One of the core concepts of the workflow engine is, that each call is user centric. This means depending of the role and access level of the current user, the workflow engine produces individual results (e.g. a user-centric tasklist or processing an open task which depends on the users role in the process).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my eyes, thus a service is not accessible from everywhere. For example if someone plans to implement a modern Ajax based JavaScript application which should use the workflow microservice there are two problems:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1) to avoid the cross-scripting problem from JavaScript/Ajax the JavaScript Web application needs to be deployed under the same domain as the microservice runs</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) if the microservice forces a user authentication (which is the case in my scenario) the application need to provide a transparent authentication mechanism. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The situation becomes more complex if the client need to access more than one user-centric microservices forcing user authentication.&#xA;I always end up with an architecture where all services and the client application running on the same application server under the same domain.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can these problems be solved?

44420585,Microservices: how to effectively deal with data dependencies between microservices,<node.js><mean-stack><microservices>,2,125,0,1.0,3,"<p>I am developing an application utilizing the microservices development approach with the mean stack.  I am running into a situation where data needs to be shared between multiple microservices.  For example, let's say I have user, video, message(sending/receiving,inbox, etc.) services.  Now the video and message records belong to an account record.  As users create video and send /receive message there is a foreign key(userId) that has to be associated with the video and message records they create. I have scenarios where I need to display the first, middle and last name associated with each video for example.  Let's now say on the front end a user is scrolling through a list of videos uploaded to the system, 50 at a time.  In the worst case scenario, I could see a situation where a pull of 50 occurs where each video is tied to a unique user.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There seems to be two approaches to this issue:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One, I make an api call to the user service and get each user tied to each video in the list.  This seems inefficient as it could get really chatty if I am making one call per video.  In the second of the api call scenario, I would get the list of video and send a distinct list of user foreign keys to query to get each user tied to each video.  This seems more efficient but still seems like I am losing performance putting everything back together to send out for display or however it needs to be manipulated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Two, whenever a new user is created, the account service sends a message with the user information each other service needs to a fanout queue and then it is the responsibility of the individual services to add the new user to a table in it's own database thus maintaining loose coupling.  The extreme downside here would be the data duplication and having to have the fanout queue to handle when updates needs to be made to ensure eventual consistency.  Though, in the long run, this approach seems like it would be the most efficient from a performance perspective.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am torn between these two approaches, as they both have their share of tradeoffs.  Which approach makes the most sense to implement and why?</p>&#xA;"
36615117,microservice messaging db-assigned identifiers,<microservices><spring-cloud-stream>,2,154,0,2.0,3,"<p>The company I work for is investigating moving from our current monolithic API to microservices. Our current API is heavily dependent on spring and we use SQL server for most persistence. Our microservice investigation is leaning toward spring-cloud, spring-cloud-stream, kafka, and polyglot persistence (isolated database per microservice). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a question about how messaging via kafka is typically done in a microservice architecture. We're planning to have a coordination layer between the set of microservices and our client applications, which will coordinate activities across different microservices and isolate clients from changes to microservice APIs. Most of the stuff we've read about using spring-cloud-stream and kafka indicate that we should use streams at the coordination layer (source) for resource change operations (inserts, updates, deletes), with the microservice being one consumer of the messages. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where I've been having trouble with this is inserts. We make heavy use of database-assigned identifiers (identity columns/auto-increment columns/sequences/surrogate keys), and they're usually assigned as part of a post request and returned to the caller. The coordination layer may be saving multiple things using different microservices and often needs the assigned identifier from one insert before it can move on to the next operation. Using messaging between the coordination layer and microservices for inserts makes it so the coordination layer can't get a response from the insert operation, so it can't get the assigned identifier that it needs. Additionally, other consumers on the stream (i.e. consumers that publish the data to a data warehouse) really need the message to contain the assigned identifier.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How are people dealing with this problem? Are database-assigned identifiers an anti-pattern in microservices? Should we expose separate microservice endpoints that return database-assigned identifiers so that the coordination layer can make a synchronous call to get an identifier before calling the asynchronous insert? We could use UUIDs but our DBAs hate those as primary keys, and they couldn't be used as an order number or other user-facing generated ids.</p>&#xA;"

Now, let's say that, after the user got the stuff, he choose one and wanna buy it. Then the ""Buying service"" will call the stuff service in order the verify the price of the item, but... It will have to check the user token since the stuff is a ""on authenticated access"", so it means that ""Buying"" service and ""Stuff"" service both check the token, which add an extra check.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I though about an internal guaranteed access between services but is it worth it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, maybe you said to implement the middleware for each service since they have a REST access, but the API Gateway would just destroy the idea of having REST access</p>&#xA;"

45167593,Authorization of actions across microservices,<web-services><rest><authorization><microservices><event-sourcing>,2,108,1,1.0,3,"<p>A modern multi-user web application imposes a lot of restrictions on the actions that users can perform. In other words, the actions require authority. For example, a user can only change its own personal data, and only members of a group can post content to that group. In a classic monolith application, such restrictions are easily enforced by joining several database tables and acting according to the results of queries. However, with microservices, it becomes much less clear where and how such limitations should be handled.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the sake of argument, consider a Facebook clone. The whole application consists of several parts:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>A front-end, written in JS and other web technologies</li>&#xA;<li>A backend consisting of a number of microservices</li>&#xA;<li>An API for retrieving and submitting data to the backend, i.e. a gateway</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As for the business logic, there are (among others) two well-known entities:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Events (as in concerts, birthday parties etc.)</li>&#xA;<li>Posts (text entries existing on walls, pages, events etc.)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Suppose that these two entities are managed by separate services, EventService and PostService. Then consider the following constraint:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>A post to an event can be deleted by two kinds of users: the author of the post, and the host(s) of the event.</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In a monolith, this constraint would've been conceptually very easy to deal with. Upon receiving a request to delete a post, supplying the post id and user id,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Fetch the event which the post belongs to.</li>&#xA;<li>Check if the user is the author of the post.</li>&#xA;<li>If yes, delete the post. If not, fetch the hosts of the event.</li>&#xA;<li>Check if the user is among the hosts.</li>&#xA;<li>If yes, delete the post.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, with a microservice strategy, I have a hard time figuring out how to divide the responsibilities of an operation like this across the services.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Alternative 1</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>An easy way around it would be to put logic like this in the gateway. That way, the same procedure as described above could essentially be performed, but with calls to the services instead of directly to the database. Rough sketch:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// Given postId and userId&#xA;// Synchronous solution for presentational purposes&#xA;&#xA;const post = postClient('GET', `/posts/${postId}`);&#xA;const hosts = eventClient('GET', `/events/${post.parentId}/hosts`);&#xA;const isHost = hosts.find(host =&gt; host.id == userId);&#xA;&#xA;if (isHost) {&#xA;    postClient('DELETE', `/posts/${postId}`);&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm not happy with this solution. Once I start putting logic like this in the gateway, it'll become very tempting to <em>always</em> do it, as it's a quick and simple way to get things done. All business logic would eventually amass in the gateway, and the services would become ""stupid"" CRUD endpoints. This would defeat the purpose of having separate services with well-defined areas of responsibility.  Furthermore, it could be slow as it could give rise to a high number of calls to the services when operations are getting more complex.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would essentially be reinventing the monolith, replacing database queries with slow and limited network calls.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Alternative 2</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another option would be to allow unlimited communication <em>between</em> services, allowing PostService to simply ask EventService whether the user is a host of the event in question before performing the delete. However, I'm afraid that having a potentially large number of microservices communicating with each other could introduce a lot of coupling in the longer run. Experts seem to generally advise against direct inter-service communication.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Alternative 3</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With a solid system for publishing and subscribing to events, the services could stay updated about what happens in other services. For example, every time a user is promoted to host in EventService, an event would be posted (e.g. <code>events.participant-status-changed, {userId: 14323, eventId: 12321, status: 'host'}</code>). PostService could subscribe to the event and remembering this fact when a request to delete a post is received.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm not quite happy with this one either. It'd create a very intricate and error-prone system, where an unhandled (but potentially rare) event could make services go out of sync. Also, there's a risk that logic would end up in the wrong place. For example, the constraint in this question would be handled by PostService even though conceptually it's a property of the event entity.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I should stress though that I'm very optimistic about the usefulness of events when implementing applications using microservices. I'm just not sure they are the answer to this category of problems.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How would you tackle this hypothetical, but quite realistic difficulty?</p>&#xA;"

Ofcourse each service like ""offers"" should send also link (to themself) in mailing task - this link will be call when the periodic email will be send and the response of this link will be generated body of email....</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which one will be better?

Would you consider using microservices in a DDD architecture to manage CRUD and data consistency for 1+ domains ? Does ""CRUDing"" and validating data with a microservice break the bounded context ? What are the best practices with dealing with microservices in a DDD architecture, if any ?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Many thanks for your contribution,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>[EDIT]</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The following article helped me to refine my thoughts : <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Microservices are useful on complex situations where monolithic systems failed at being maintainable. They are not good candidates for upfront design implementations. On the other hand, DDD tries to tackle complexity at the very beginning of the projects. Successful DDD should not meet microservices implementations.</p>&#xA;"
