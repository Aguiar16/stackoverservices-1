40108015,Microservice's High availability concern on cloud,<cloud><microservices>,1,230,3,0.0,0,"<p>I was reading about Microservices and everything makes sense to me but I have one little doubt.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>On cloud, every component has a availability SLA (lets assume 99.9%). So, if we have a single component to do a job, our application SLA would be the same (approx.). But if we create multiple components to do one job, our application's SLA would be reduced because all the components can go down at different time. In microservices, one service can communicate to other services to complete a task. Now, any of the participant service can be down at different time, So our application availability will be lesser compared to monolithic service?</p>&#xA;"

40413453,Aggregated Notification Microservice,<microservices>,1,728,1,0.0,1,"<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We are currently architecting our new Notification Microservice but having trouble with how to handle aggregated emails. What we need to do is instead of sending one email every action performed (could be 20+ in a few minutes), we would send an email after an hour summarising all the actions that were completed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>What We Have So Far</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We so far propose that we have this type of messaging pattern, where Client Service is any service in our cluster and Messagebot is our Notification Microservice.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Client Service sends a notification to Messagebot that it will need to send something in the future</li>&#xA;<li>Messagebot stores the details in its database</li>&#xA;<li>Messagebot periodically checks its database for what needs to be sent</li>&#xA;<li>Messagebot gets the required data from another service (could be Client Service) via API</li>&#xA;<li>Messagebot sends email using the data from #3 and an HTML template</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>The Debate</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the data that needs to be sent, we are less sure and it is what we need help with. So far we think this should be the structure of the JSON from Client Service to Notification Service (step #1):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{&#xA;    template_id: SOME_TEMPLATE_ID,&#xA;    user_id: SOME_USER_ID,&#xA;    objectid: SOME_OBJECT_ID&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>or</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{&#xA;    template_id: SOME_TEMPLATE_ID,&#xA;    user_id: SOME_USER_ID,&#xA;    required_objects: { task_id: SOME_TASK_ID, document_id: SOME_DOCUMENT_ID }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where task_id and document_id are just examples and it would change based on the template. It could just as easily be <code>{product_id: SOME_PRODUCT_ID}</code> for a different template.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Why The Debate</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Our thoughts so far are that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>We only need template_id because the source of the data would be implied in the objects (like an ENV var). For example, the Task object would be at <a href=""http://taskservice/:id"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://taskservice/:id</a>. Otherwise, we can have problems with failing APIs or switching URLs in the future.</li>&#xA;<li>We should use userid instead of email and name because we prevent the issue of email/ name pairs not matching up over multiple messages</li>&#xA;<li>For the objects, we're still sceptical because it means that the client app service would need knowledge of the inner workings in Messagebot but a single objectid might not be very extensible. We could easily imagine many of our messages needing more than one object.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you for reading. The design of this service is important because it will be central to our entire organisation. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which debated JSON structure is most appropriate in our situation? Also, knowing our requirements, what would be the proper setup for this type of service? (aka. Are we correct in our other assumptions?)</p>&#xA;"

I want to build a service for authentication. When client get a token from authentication service. Client use it for further request to others services. Client need to attach that token in header of request. The services receiving token need to verify the token by sending it to authentication server. So all requests that clients make to protected routes need to be verified by authentication service. The thing is I do not know the best place to put the code that automatically sends token to authentication service and receive the result. &#xA;Here is what i tried so far:&#xA;I implemented a middleware like that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>class VerifyTokenMiddleware(object):&#xA;&#xA;def process_request(self, request):&#xA;    if not request.META.get('HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'):&#xA;        return HttpResponse(status=404)&#xA;    auth_header = request.META.get('HTTP_AUTHORIZATION')&#xA;    token = auth_header[4:]&#xA;    response = requests.post(AUTH_URL, {""token"": token})&#xA;    if response.status_code == 400:&#xA;        return HttpResponse(status=403)&#xA;    return None&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, the problem of my solution is every requests to services(not auth service) have to pass through that middleware.

For example the loading service would consume from list(<code>unit-status-created</code>, <code>unit-status-deleted</code>, <code>unit-status-packaged</code>). This allows services to show interest in only specific events, but it requires a code or config change in potentially all service when a new status topic is added. </li>&#xA;<li>Give each status it's own partition and consume from all partitions except the one you produce in. This design makes things more complicated (bookkeeping which partition contains a specific status), does not auto balance when partitions are added, adding partitions while live makes things a bit more risky, therefore does not have my preference. </li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"

32574103,Microservices - how to solve security and user authentication?,<authentication><java-ee><microservices>,2,1504,1,2.0,3,"<p>There is a lot of discussion about microservice architecture. What I am missing - or maybe what I did not yet understand is, how to solve the issue of security and user authentication?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example: I develop a microservice which provides a Rest Service interface to a workflow engine. The engine is based on JEE and runs on application servers like GlassFish or Wildfly. &#xA;One of the core concepts of the workflow engine is, that each call is user centric. This means depending of the role and access level of the current user, the workflow engine produces individual results (e.g. a user-centric tasklist or processing an open task which depends on the users role in the process).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my eyes, thus a service is not accessible from everywhere. For example if someone plans to implement a modern Ajax based JavaScript application which should use the workflow microservice there are two problems:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1) to avoid the cross-scripting problem from JavaScript/Ajax the JavaScript Web application needs to be deployed under the same domain as the microservice runs</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) if the microservice forces a user authentication (which is the case in my scenario) the application need to provide a transparent authentication mechanism. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The situation becomes more complex if the client need to access more than one user-centric microservices forcing user authentication.&#xA;I always end up with an architecture where all services and the client application running on the same application server under the same domain.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can these problems be solved?

However, my scenario is a bit different:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>I'm only using Oauth2 for single sign on and token generation for microservices.

The user authenticates for the server-side app (by using Oauth2 authorization code flow).</li>&#xA;<li>Then if I need to retrieve data from an API, I call my ASP.NET MVC app from React (by sending a simple cookie).

Do this conversion in your API gateway.</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However it's not clear to me what's reason behind it. I suspect it might be due to some security benefits (not to give client possibility to read any specific info). Because in the JWT token itself it might be info about roles/permission. But for this purpose token can also be encrypted.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another reason might be that JWT token is too big and in order to don't carry this token every time such approach might be used. (or if JWT token is stored in cookie it has size limits).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I haven't seen any info that JWT token authentication is compromised and it's a bad practice to keep it on client (in browser).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>On the other hand I see that Ping Identity is also using <strong>pass by reference</strong> approach.
